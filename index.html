                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">&nbsp;<br>Entrepreneurship is  a complex decision domain. It is essential that solutions designed for complex domains like entrepreneurship must consider factors like massive diversity, context sensitivity, non-linearity, inter-relatedness, emergent property, etc. Regardless of this, most of the dominant perspectives still assume that entrepreneurship is the same all over the world. The proposed solutions and methods are often developed without any consideration to the diversity and uniqueness of personal, historical, cultural, institutional, social, and spatial contexts. <br><br>While entrepreneurship operates in the evolutionary edge of social emergence, most of the current thinkers and their models never truly acknowledged its massive uncertainty, possible varieties, and complexity.&nbsp; Further, the need for appropriate methods are neglected in favor of reductionistic one size fits all prescriptive models, cliche advise, and Incrementalism. <br><br>In the following part I am introducing a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>contextually adaptive entrepreneurial framework for a complex world.&nbsp;The framework is created as an integrative and harmonizing design solution that embodies dispositions like holism, evolvability, diversity, adaptability, meta-cognition, learnability, agency, praxis, feedback, etc. which are essential for dealing with a complex-emergent decision domain like entrepreneurship.<br><br>The framework as a starting point establishes 9 entrepreneurial exploratory dimensions as enabling constraints represented by the abbreviation <strong>ASTRONAUT</strong>; <strong>A:</strong> Agent(end user), <strong>S:</strong> Socio-materiality, <strong>T:</strong> Temporal and Contextual Factors, <strong>R:</strong> Real Needs/Wants/Choices,&nbsp;<strong>O:</strong>Organization and Delivery system,<strong> N: </strong>Network and ecosystem dependencies,<strong> A:</strong>Atmosphere,<strong>  U: </strong>Unconventional forces, <strong>T: </strong>Thatva representing various dispositions. Since evolvability is the core foundation of the design, the learning never stops and framework itself changes, adapts and evolves to suit emerging demands.&nbsp;<br></p>

It is affected by a large number of inter-connected and interacting variables(Bygrave and Minniti, 2000; Giannetti and Simonov,2009), and depends on numerous contextual factors(Welter, 2011; Audretsch. et. al, 2012). This may include things like socio-economic status(Giacomin et al. 2011), education(Millan et al. 2014), gender(Warnecke, 2013; Marlow and Martinez, 2018), time(Klyver et al., 2018; Bird and West, 1997), history(Wadhwani, 2016), location(Audretsch et al., 2012; Storey and Johnson, 2002), stakeholders(Dew and Sarasvathy, 2007), cognition(Dew, et al. 2015; Grégoire et al. 2011; Ward, 2004), intentions(Krueger et al., 2000; Fayolle and Liñán,2014; Krueger, 2017), skills(Lazear, 2004; Hsieh et al, 2017; Oosterbeek et al, 2010), opportunity recognition(Singh, 2001; Lumpkin and Lichtenstein, 2005), acquisition of resources(Leung et al. 2006; Martens et al. 2007), product development(Giardino, et al.,2014), marketing(Lam and Harker, 2015), etc.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the major implication of such complexity in entrepreneurship is the inherent uncertainty when it comes to decision making (Knight, 1921 ). In complex domains like entrepreneurship past behavior cases may not predict the future. This makes it impossible to reliably predict events in such a condition. To predict an event accurately, we need to have a stable system with adequate data. In the case of complex emergent systems, history never repeats. This is why when studying complex domains like entrepreneurship it is essential to use a complexity lens(Berger and Kuckertz, 2016). <br>
<br>In the following part of the chapter I am going to develop two of my core arguments.
<br>
<br>1. What is complexity and Why entrepreneurship is called a complex decision domain: In this part I will explore the nature of complexity by looking in to scientific and also decision-making implications of complexity. I will then list down some of the core features of entrepreneurial complexity 
<br>  
<br>2. Problems with existing models: Although entrepreneurship is a complex field most of the existing prescriptive action models like lean startup or business planning, etc are created without any consideration to the essence of complexity. In this part I will list some of the core weakness of existing entrepreneurship models when dealing with complexity.<br></p>

</strong><br>
<br>The definition of complexity is by itself context dependent(Standish, 2001). Its usefulness depends mostly on the domain and specific problems in question. This further add to the difficulty in providing a universal definition of complexity. In-order to have a generic definition applicable to all contexts it is necessary to have adequate flexibility. Bruce Edmonds proposes a meta level and accommodative definition of complexity i.e: <strong><em>“That property of a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its overall behavior, even when given almost complete information about its atomic components and their inter-relations”</em></strong>(Edmonds, 1995). According to him this is a very general definition, which is intended to have different interpretations in different contexts. <br><br>Melanie Mitchell(2009) also agrees with the above observation by suggesting that "various(complex) systems are quite different',  but viewed at an abstract level they have some intriguing properties in common", they are; <strong>Complex collective behavior:</strong> It is the collective action of vast numbers of components that give rise to the complex, hard-to-predict, and changing patterns of behavior that fascinate us; <strong>Signaling and information processing:</strong> Complex systems produce and use information and signals from both their internal and external environments; and <strong>Adaptation:</strong> All these systems adapt—that is, change their behavior to improve their chances of survival or success—through learning or evolutionary processes.
Combining this observation, she proposes her definition of a complex system, i.e. <em><strong>"a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution"</strong></em>(Mitchell, 2009). For an explanation from the entrepreneurship field, Benyamin Lichtenstein(2000) suggested that there are four assumptions characterizing complex systems, They are; Dynamics—Complex systems are dynamic and constantly changing; Irreducibility of elements: Elements are Irreducible due to the entwined nature of the elements; Interdependencies—The causality in complex systems cannot be described by
linear models, as the causality is interdependent; Non-proportionality—Small inputs might have a large impact, whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome.<br> 
<br><strong>Understanding by distinction
<br></strong> 
<br>Apart from definition, One of the best ways to understand the nature of complexity is to find how it is different from other systems like e.g. simple and complicated. Complexity as a field of scientific inquiry was explained well by such a distinction developed by American mathematician Warren Weaver in his paper called Science and Complexity(1948).<br><br>Weaver(1991) divided the problems of interest in science into three categories. The first category is called Problems of Simplicity. These are problems in which two things are related to each other. These problems are characterized by just a few variables and relations between them.The problems of simplicity was solved by science by developing experimental and analytical methods for handling problems in which one variable, say a gas pressure, depends primarily upon a second quantity, eg, the volume of the gas. These problems are characterized by the fact that the behavior of the first quantity can be described with a some degree of accuracy by taking into account only its dependence upon the second variable and by ignoring negligible influence of other factors.&nbsp; He calls the second category problems of Disorganized Complexity. According to him a problem of disorganized complexity “is a problem in which the number of variables is very large, and one in which each of the many variables has a behavior which is individually erratic, or perhaps totally unknown. However, in spite of the unknowns, behavior of all the individual variables, the system as a whole possesses certain orderly and analyzable average properties. These are understood through taking averages over the large set of variables while ignoring or assuming very little interaction among the variables. Example of such systems are ideal gas (as discussed in thermodynamics) and random coin tosses (as discussed in probability theory). In addition to “problems of simplicity” that are solvable with hard sciences and “disorganized complexity” that can be dealt with statistics and probability, Weaver introduced a third kind called problems of organized complexity. These are problems that involve a moderate to large number of variables. But the key here is that, due to their strong nonlinear interactions, the variables cannot be meaningfully averaged. Weaver characterized these as "problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole", such as a biological or societal system.&nbsp;<br><br>Another powerful model that gives a lot of clarity from distinction is a sense-making framework developed by Dave Snowden(Snowden, 2010) called Cynefin. It differentiate between three kinds of systems(Beurden et al., 2013):
Ordered systems(simple/ complicated) in which cause and effect relationships are either clear or discoverable through analysis; Chaotic systems in which turbulence prevails and immediate stabilizing action is required; and Complex systems in which the only way to understand the system is to interact. In a complicated context, at least one right
answer exists. "In a complex context, however,
right answers can’t be ferreted out. It’s like the
difference between, say, a Ferrari and the
Brazilian rain-forest. Ferraris are complicated
machines, but an expert mechanic can take
one apart and reassemble it without changing
a thing. The car is static, and the whole is the
sum of its parts. The rain-forest, on the other
hand, is in constant flux—a species becomes
extinct, weather patterns change, an agricultural project reroutes a water source—and the
whole is far more than the sum of its parts"(Snowden and Boone, 2007).<br><br><br><strong>Complexity and Entrepreneurship<br></strong><br>It has to be noted that entrepreneurship has components of all decision types(ordered, complex and chaotic Or&nbsp;problems of simplicity, disorganized complexity,&nbsp; organized complexity). But core aspect of venture creation comes mostly under Weaver's third category, organized complexity; or other-words a complex domain.&nbsp; Even though scholars have widely recognized entrepreneurship as a complex and highly uncertain process((Lichtenstein et al, 2007; Brouwer, 2000), it is still popularly depicted as an individual activity(Drakopoulou ,2007) that takes place in a perfect market. In most cases, the role of the individual entrepreneur is exaggerated in such representation(Gaddefors and Anderson, 2017). Complex domains like entrepreneurship exhibit several features which cannot be taken account by most currently existing reductionist models and perspectives(Berger and Kuckertz, 2016).&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br></strong><strong>Following are some of the major characteristics of a complex system(or&nbsp;complex adaptive system) with entrepreneurship as an example.&nbsp;</strong>It is important to keep in mind that these characteristics are not separate from each other, and each require all others for any attempt to explain it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1. Large number of heterogeneous agents/components/elements:</strong> <br><br>Complex systems consist of a large number of elements that in themselves can be simple. When the
number of elements are relatively small, the behaviour of the elements can often be&nbsp; given a formal description in conventional terms. However, when the
number becomes sufficiently large, conventional means&nbsp;not only become impractical, they also cease
to assist in any understanding of the system(Cilliers, 2002).&nbsp; Further, these elements can be heterogeneous, in that they differ in their behavior, location, history, or other properties. Such heterogeneity, in turn, can have far-reaching impacts on the functioning of the system. For example, different species within an ecosystem will have been in the ecosystem for different lengths of time, possess different functional traits, and occupy different niches(Fisher, 2020). <br><br>Heterogeneity of entrepreneurship(Spilling, 2008) may manifest in many dimensions, which are by themselves complex; e.g. entrepreneur, cognition, skills, disposition, idea, customer, teams, investors, venture capitalists, government, bureaucracy, consultants, location, networks, resources, market, technology, law, policy, connection, trust, etc. The importance and inevitability of heterogeneity in entrepreneurship is evident from scholarly works focusing on various perspectives to approach heterogeneity(Davidsson, 2007; Breitenecker and Harms, 2010; Dufays and Huybrechts, 2016).&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>2. Non-Linear dynamics and interaction among elements(agents/components/variables):</strong><br><strong><br></strong>According to Cilliers(2002), large number of elements are necessary, but not sufficient. In order to constitute a complex system, the elements have to interact, and this interaction must be dynamic. A complex system changes with time. The interactions do not have to be physical; they can also be thought of as the transference of information.This is also evident from Herbert Simon's definition of a complex system; ie. "one made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions"(Simon 1996). Secondly, the interactions are non-linear. A large system of linear elements can usually be collapsed into an equivalent system that is very much smaller. Non-linearity also guarantees that small causes can have large results, and vice versa.&nbsp;Further, even if specific agents may only interact with a few others, the impact of these interactions are propagated throughout the system&nbsp; Through this interaction, agents strives to improve its fitness with the environment but the outcome of these attempts depends on the disposition and behaviors of other agents(Mitleton-Kelly, 2003).
<br><br>In entrepreneurship, agents interact with others in a non-linear manner. For example, an entrepreneur at the same time have to interact with his team, investors, customers, partners, government, etc. He/She gets feedback from the interaction, which triggers more interaction. These interaction will not follow a certain format or order, other words, it is non-linear. Further, studies have also found that successful entrepreneurship ecosystems outperform others due in part to more amplifying and less dampening
of nonlinear interactions(Han et al,2021).<br><br><br><strong>3. Feedback Loop:&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Complex systems are characterized by feedback loops in which the product of the process is necessary for the process itself. A feedback loop is “a circular arrangement of causally connected&nbsp;elements, so that each element has an effect on the next, until the last “feeds back” the effect into the first element of the cycle”(Capra 1997, 56). Change in a variable results in either an amplification (positive feedback) or a dampening (negative feedback) of that change(Kastens et al., 2009). Both kinds(positive---enhancing, stimulating or negative---detracting, inhibiting) are necessary. The technical term for this aspect of a complex system is recurrency(Cilliers, 2002). Further, when the interactions of large numbers of components involve positive feedback loops, some behaviors self amplify, quickly crowding out others. Groups of components become locked into self-reinforcing feedback cycles that lead to predictable collective behavior(Anderson, 1999). 
<br><br>Many scholars also stress on the non-linearity aspect of feedback loops, calling it non-linear feedback loops(Juarrero, 1999: 47-48).&nbsp; According to  Ralph Stacey(1995) organizations are nonlinear network feedback systems and it therefore follows
logically that the fundamental properties of such
systems should apply to organizations. Example from entrepreneurship include explicit feedback like customer feedback(Eisenmann et al., 2012), stakeholder feedback, but also long term positive or negative feedback. At a macro level entrepreneurship is impacted by monetary policy, social climate, etc, and will impact the same by looping back; Like that economic activity promotes entrepreneurship and innovation activities, and the entrepreneurship enhances economic activity by looping back(Galindo and Méndez, 2014). Feedback is also discussed in entrepreneurship literature as the one aiding effective decision making(Haynie and Shepherd, 2007).All of these are complex adaptive systems.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>4. Emergence(+ Irreducibility, Non-proportionality):</strong> <br><br>Complex systems show emergent property. Basically, emergence is a systemic process through which properties and or structures come into being that are unexpected,
given the known attributes of component agents and environmental forces(Lichtenstein and McKelvey, 2011).&nbsp;Emergent properties refers
to a characteristic that is found across the system but which individual parts
of the system do not themselves hold. Other-words, if a thing can have properties or capabilities that are not possessed by its parts, such properties are called emergent properties(Elder-Vass, 2014). The emergent higher order behaviour cannot simply be derived by aggregating behaviour at the level of the elements(<strong>Irreducibility,&nbsp;</strong>Beckage, 2013). This is because the whole is more than the sum of its parts when it comes of complexity.&nbsp; Another feature of emergent property is <strong>non-proportionality</strong>(Lichtenstein and Mendenhall, 2002). The effect of an input is not proportional to the strength of that input. Due to the non-proportionality, small inputs might have a large impact<strong>,</strong> whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome.&nbsp;<br><br>Entrepreneurship scholars for long had identified the importance of emergence as a frame for understanding entrepreneurial complexity(Katz and Gartner 1988; Gartner, 1993; Lichtenstein, el al, 2006; Fuller et al, 2008). Emergent property is manifested in entrepreneurship in many different ways. At the basic level entrepreneurial venture or a startup itself is an example of emergent property of large number of factors like intention, cognition, various skills, various stakeholders, location, experts, policy, networks, technology, etc. Further, emergence is manifested at the macro level when innovations breed other innovations(e.g. internet, google by democratizing information access), technologies that result in new disruptive responses, emergence of new markets and new business models(e.g. app store, android) and collaborative activities(social media, collaboration apps), etc.&nbsp;<br><br>The implication of emergent property is that, an opportunity (product, organization, market)can come into reality in the absence of deliberate planning.&nbsp;Users often adapt products to support tasks that designers never intended(Johnson, 2006). E.g. Instagram was started as an HTML5 supported location-based service; Facebook was started as&nbsp;an app to compare two people’s pictures and rate which one was more attractive&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>5. Self-Organisation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Self-organization refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level(Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r 2003; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex
organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of
lower-level entities. The final product is the result of nonlinear
interactions rather than planning and design, and is not known
a priori(De Roo, 2016).
This can be contrasted with the top-down approaches where planning precedes implementation, and the
desired final system is known by design.&nbsp;In self-organisation there is no hierarchy of command and control and there is no planning or managing, but there is a constant re-organizing to find
the best fit with the environment.&nbsp;The system is continually self
organizing through the process of emergence and feedback. It changes the relationships
between the distributed elements of the system under influence of both the
external environment and the history of the system(Cilliers, 2002). Further, emergence happen naturally from the interactions within a complex system; they do not need to be imposed top down in a centralized way. For example, termites are known to construct the highest structures on the planet relative to the size of the builders. Yet there is no chief executive among termites, no architect termite, and no blueprint. Each termite acts locally, following only a few simple shared rules of behaviour, within a context of other termites also acting locally. The termite mound emerges from this process of self organisation(Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001).
<br>&nbsp;<br>We can find self-organisation as a important character of market, business and entrepreneurship. For example, we can see the venture as self-organized system emerged to satisfy customer demands. It can be the result of self-organization like, Effectuation(Sarasvathy, 2001), Entrepreneurial bricolage(Baker and Nelson, 2005), User innovation(Hippel, 1988), etc. Further, according to Peltoniemi &amp; Vuori(2004), even "the formation of a
business ecosystem is a process where participants are gathered voluntarily and without
external or internal leader. Goals are set in local interactions, where companies negotiate and
create new order."<br><br><strong>6. Fuzzy boundaries and Nested-embedded complexity:&nbsp;</strong>In complicated system like a car or algorithm, boundaries are fixed and well defined. Complex systems are systems typically characterized with fuzzy boundaries. Membership of a complex system can change, and agents can simultaneously be members of several systems(Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001). E.g. investor could be a family member or she might invest in other companies, or join as a startup team member. <br><br>Complex systems are also embedded/nested in other systems which are constantly interacting with one another. For example, Our planet is a complex system, as is our body, the organizations
that we create, or our social and economic systems(Héraud et al. 2019). When it comes to economic system, buyers and sellers form markets and markets form economies, whereas the buyers and sellers themselves can be people or organizations formed by people(Noell, 2007). All of these are complex systems by themselves. Because of this embedded nature, it is virtually impossible to accurately mark the boundaries of one system from other systems. Further, Since each agent and each system is nested within other systems, all evolving together and interacting, we cannot fully understand any of the agents or systems without reference to the others(Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001).<br><br>An entrepreneur is a system nested/embedded itself with other complex systems like startup team, customers, market, investors, family, suppliers, partners, government, country and society itself.&nbsp;In fields of study like entrepreneurship, business, organisation, etc, scholars have been exploring the nested and embedded nature of multiple complex co-evolving systems(Holm,1995; Baum and Singh, 1994; Dieleman and Sachs, 2008; Ng, 2011). Scholars have also explored contextually embedded nature of entrepreneurial actors(Baker and Welter, 2018; Autio et al, 2014; Lounsbury et al, 2019), suggesting the entangled and embedded nature of entrepreneurship to the context in which it is situated.&nbsp;<br>
<br><br><br><br><strong>7. Dynamics of evolution: Evolution, Adaptation, Co-evolution, Path Dependence:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Complex systems follow the dynamics of evolution. The behaviour of complex systems evolves from the interaction of agents at a local level without external direction or the presence of internal control(Kernick, 2006). This should not be viewed as local darwinian processes and optimization alone(Pendleton and Brown, 2018), but also as dynamic exchanges between components and the system as a whole, impacting other complex systems. Following are some of the ways in which dynamics of evolution manifests in complex systems.&nbsp;First of all, adaptation forms one of the fundamental aspect of evolution. All complex systems adapt—that is, change their behavior to improve their chances of survival or success—through learning or evolutionary processes(Melanie Mitchell, 2009). They can (re)organize their internal structure without the intervention of an external agent.(Paul Cilliers, Emergence, March 2000).&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, In nature and complex systems, evolution is manifested in the&nbsp; form of co-evolution(Ehrlich and Raven, 1964). When organisms adapts in a reciprocal way, it will lead to Coevolution(Thompson and Cunningham, 2002). It refers to the simultaneous evolution of entities and their environments, whether these entities are organisms or organizations (Baum &amp; Singh, 1994).&nbsp; It encompasses the twin notions of interdependency and mutual adaptation, with the idea that species or organizations evolve in relation to their environments, while at the same time these environments evolve in relation to them(Porter, 2006). Adding to this we can take Kauffman's(1993, 237) observation that, "all ‘evolution’ is really coevolution". According to him, "the true and stunning success of biology reflects the fact
that organisms do not merely evolve, they coevolve both
with other organisms and with a changing abiotic
environment". He argues that coevolution is at the root of self-organizing
behaviour, constant change in systems, the production of
novel macro structures, and non-linearities. Further, according to Cilliers(2002), Complex systems have a history. Not only do they evolve through time, but their past is co-responsible for their present behaviour. This is equivalent to ideas like path dependence( Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995;Tripsas &amp; Gavetti, 2000), lock-in's(Arthur, 1989), or Imprinting(Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007; Milanov &amp;
Fernhaber, 2009), etc. <br><br>An evolutionary perspective is indispensable from the complexity worldview of entrepreneurship. According to Christian Cordes et al(2008), "firms are culturally variable and evolve new cultural forms as time passes. This
evolution is partly driven by entrepreneurs and other business leaders in entrepreneurial roles(Penrose, 1959; Langlois, 1998), partly by the decisions made by rank-and-file members, partly
by the firm’s competitive success or failure (Alchian, 1950), and partly by cultural evolution in
the larger society within which firms are embedded". Acknowledging this centrality, evolutionary dynamics in entrepreneurship is one of the most widely explored topic among scholars. This include meta level exploration of the evolution of the field itself(Landström, 2020; Carlsson et al, 2013)to various other dimensions of evolutionary dynamics(Schaltegger et al. 2016; Pacheco et al., 2014; Tiwana et al., 2010; Bosch et al.,1999; Inkpen et al., 2004; Lewin et al, 1999; Jones, 2001; Grodal et al., 2015).<br>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>8. Attractor behaviour
</strong><br><br>In complex emergent system, an attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through. They are islands of stability in a sea of chaos. Complex systems are inherently uncertain, but, they usually settle down into one of a number of possible steady states. These steady states are called "attractor basins".&nbsp;<br>As a universal feature of complex adaptive systems, the dynamics of attractors are active in the entrepreneurship too. Complexity theory views organizations(or startups, new venture, etc) as “complex adaptive systems” that coevolve with the environment through the selforganizing behavior of agents navigating “fitness landscapes” (Kauffman, 1995) of market opportunities and competitive dynamics(Coleman, 1999). Such self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Once there, the further dynamics and evolution of the system are likely constrained to remain near the attractor(Ashby, W. R., 1947).&nbsp; This also means changing external and internal “attractors” influence the process of adaptation by agents (Coleman, 1999; Stacey, 1996).&nbsp; Since attractors are the most stable and robust elements in these systems, they are more feasible targets for foresight than the several variants that they configure and effectuate(Kuhmonen, 2017).<br>&nbsp;<br>The word ‘attractor’ has the connotation that it attracts the system to a certain state. However, an it is not a ‘thing’ out there, but an expression of the extent to which a system can change, indicated by its resilience against disturbances(Gerrits, 2012; Marion, 1999). Further, it is a model representation of a system’s behaviour. It is not a force of attraction or a goal-oriented presence in the system; it simply depicts where the system is headed based on its rules of motion(Dolan et al, 2000)
<br> 
<br>There are 3 major types of attractors(Gerrits, 2012).  When a system always return to exactly the same state when under pressure, it can be expressed by a fixed point attractor(Otter, 2000). A periodic or torus attractor describes the alternation of systems between a limited number of states (Mackenzie, 2005). The third category is highlighted by the inability of a system to return to any of its previous states, in which--each new state is ever so slightly different from the previous one. This category is called the strange attractor (Byrne, 2002). It can remain in this current state because of existing feedback loops that maintain a particular situation. It limits the dynamics of the system but also make it impossible to  predict exactly where the system is going to be.
<br>
<br>The strange attractor is very important in domains like entrepreneurship, business, sociology, etc, because many of the dynamics in these systems actually behave as if they were guided by these strange attractors. They don't go back to the old state, or jump between states, but guided by dynamics of strange attractors.  New market opportunities good example of attractors. These attractors “pull” entrepreneurs to innovate within existing firms or found new enterprises (Miles et al., 1998).&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>9. Miscellaneous<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>Apart from the above 8, following are also core aspects of complex systems.
<br>
<br><strong>Complex systems have a history and history matters;</strong> According to Cilliers(2002), Complex systems have a history. Not only do they evolve through time, but their past is co-responsible for their present behaviour. This is equivalent to ideas like path dependence( Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995); lock-in's(Arthur, 1989), or Imprinting(Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007), etc.<br>
<br><strong>Complex systems are open systems; </strong>They exchange energy or information with their environment—and operate at conditions far from equilibrium. It is also important to note that Self-organization only occurs in such open systems that import energy from the outside (Prigogine and  Lefever, 1974). As a result of this, it is often difficult to define the border of a complex system. Further, closed systems are usually merely complicated(Cilliers, 2002). Eg. A venture started in India will be affected by dynamics of US or Chinese markets, Oil price, technology emergence, crisis like COVID, etc. All these factors are not going to affect the functining of complicated system like a PC, car, or a machine. 
<br>
<br><strong>Complex systems evolves in the adjacent possible</strong>(Kauffman, 1996); a zone towards which change and evolution is more likely because of current disposition of the system. The concept of “adjacent possible” was introduced by Stuart Kauffman(1996; 2000) in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems to explain how biological evolution can be seen as exploration and actualization of what is adjacent possible. It can be defined as “the set of possibilities available to individuals, communities, institutions, organisms, productive processes, etc., at a given point in time during their evolution” (Loreto, 2015). The concept of the “adjacent possible” is useful for understanding how entrepreneurial adjacent possibilities emerge, and how the new adjacent possible will lead to yet newer adjacent possibilities.
<br>
<br><strong>Complex adaptive&nbsp;systems like entrepreneurship display power law distributions</strong>; Power laws and outliers are pervasively present across many types of variables that are central to most entrepreneurial activities(Crawford et al, 2015). It is also clear in success and impact of entrepreneurial ventures. For example, 95% of all U.S. businesses are small--employing 20 people or fewer, and more than 60% of all new jobs are created by a mere .03% of all entrepreneurial start-ups. Further, most successful companies of our time, Facebook , Google, Apple, Amazon,Walmart, etc, are extreme outliers (Aguinis and Joo, 2015). 
<br>
<br><strong>Finally, Complex systems may show behaviors</strong> like Mathew effect(those who begin with advantage accumulate more advantage over time and vice-versa for those who begin with disadvantage), Network effect( increases in product value with increases in the number of users), Preferential attachment( more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links). For e.g. Initial success improves access to deal flow in venture capital, which leads to accumulated advantage(Nanda,2020). These effects may explain the success of already successful or second time entrepreneurs, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Domains like entrepreneurship exemplify all of the previously listed characteristics of a complex system. Following are some of the characteristics of decision making in real world complexity.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decisions involve uncertainty</strong>(Knight,1921)<strong>.&nbsp;</strong> This will limit the scope for identifying a rationally optimum decision and allow for a range of competing proposals and preferences to claim credibility(Lyles, 1981). Uncertainty can be viewed as part of real world and it affects individuals at various levels(Folta, 2007; Platt and  Huettel, 2008). The role of uncertainty and various dimensions of it in entrepreneurship is also a widely observed phenomena(Sarasvathy and Kotha, 2001; Bylund, and  McCaffrey, 2017) 
<br>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decisions are affected or constrained by Human Bounded Rationality;</strong>  In a complex and uncertain world, humans make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Herbert Simon(1957, 1964) thus argued that humans have a bounded rationality. He suggested that the complexity of the environment and humans’ limited cognitive system make maximization impossible in most real-life decision-making situations.&nbsp;<br><br><strong> 
*Real world decision contexts thus are mostly based on satificing logic(Simon, 1947; Brown,2004):</strong> We rarely make a decision after possessing all the facts, and as a corollary, In practice, we rarely make a decision based on all the facts in our possession. This is  Simon’s(March and Simon, 1958) notion of ‘satisficing’, which refers to the less than optimal choices due to decision makers’ bounded rationality or limited cognitive capacities and lack of time and energy.&nbsp;This involves using of simple rules than complicated models, otherwise known as heuristics(Gigerenzer, 2011).<br><br><strong>*&nbsp;Real world decisions are context dependent</strong>(Trueblood et al, 2013; Hutchins and Klausen, 1996). As demonstrated by Herbert Simon's(1990) scissors analogy, real world decisions must include cognition and context(environment).&nbsp;In other-words&nbsp;we can say, real world cognition and decision making are<strong>;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>ecological</strong>(Gibson, 1979); <strong>embodied, embedded, enactive</strong>(Varela et al., 1992) and <strong>extended</strong>(Clark and  Chalmers, 1998) outside of our brain. This means it is essentially impossible to understand(or effect) real world decisions by cognitive reductionism.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>* Real world decision making in complex domains can be understood in different ways.</strong> Following are 3 of them(Campbell, 1988). Firstly, as&nbsp;a subjective psychological experience. Secondly as&nbsp;an interaction between task and
person characteristics(March and Simon, 1958), in that, tasks can be said to be more or less complex relative to the capabilities of the individuals who perform the
task. Thirdly, as a function of objective domain or task characteristics(climate change, Entrepreneurship).&nbsp;<em><br></em>
<br><strong>* Real world decision contexts&nbsp;doesn't have boundaries.</strong> Categories like Simple, complicated, complex, chaotic(Snowden and Boone, 2007), even though discussed and studied separately, may appear part of a real world decision context.  This means a decision makers deliberately or intuitively engages in continues sense making effort(Kurtz and Snowden, 2003) to identify the decision context they are in. For example the core aspect of entrepreneurship is complex and uncertain. Even though this is the case, there are <strong>complicated jobs</strong> to be done like a lawyers job, accounting, etc. Simple jobs like switching on the lights, cleaning the floor, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decision makers use ambidextrous methods:</strong> Entrepreneurs use both <strong>causal and effectual approaches</strong> in
a variety of combinations. Both causation and effectuation are integral parts of human reasoning
that can occur simultaneously, overlapping and intertwining over different contexts of decisions and actions(Sarasvathy, 2009). According to Yang and Gabrielsson(2017), entrepreneurs use <strong>ambidexterity</strong> in methods. i.e. the capability to employ both <strong>exploration and exploitation</strong> methods, or simultaneously use the effectual process to explore and create a new market, and the causal process to exploit the
existing market. Further,&nbsp;<br><br>* <strong>Real world problems don’t care about disciplinary boundaries(Bendix, 2020)</strong>. This asserts that, Interdisciplinary working is needed in order to explore the ‘real world’ problems(Dalrymple and Miller, 2006). This awareness may help the decision maker to expand the search space. Real world entrepreneurship is contextual and according to Welter’s (2011), "a contextualized view on entrepreneurship asks for an interdisciplinary perspective, as the solution cannot be to develop an overarching theory of entrepreneurship in all contexts, but rather working with disciplines like anthropology, sociology, and others, which possess some of the tools and concepts entrepreneurship scholars need to explore the variety, depths and richness of contexts.”. Scholars have also acknowledged this importance in entrepreneurship education(Penaluna and Penaluna, 2009; Janssen et al, 2007)<br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>* Real world predictions about future cannot be accurate even with all the knowledge&nbsp;about the past.</strong>&nbsp;Out past and history is important because of the path dependence, but it can only suggest insights about the current disposition, not an accurate future state. This can be explained by the butterfly effect which occurs when a very, very small change in one part of a complex adaptive system,which may initially go unrecognized results in a huge or massive disruption, surprise, or turbulence. The results may be impossible to predict(Bennet and Bennet, 2008). This is because we cant get accurate and massive amount of data required. There is also unavoidable uncertainty in the initial condition(Boffetta et al, 2002).&nbsp;<br><br><br>*<strong>Real world decisions involves a trade off between Exploit(efficiency) and Explore(evolvability)</strong>: Many decisions in the lives of animals and humans require a fine balance between the exploration of
different options and the exploitation of their rewards(Mehlhorn et al, 2015) . Exploitation maximizes rewards in the near-term, while the information obtained during exploration can later be used to maximize rewards in the long-term(Barack and Gold, 2016).&nbsp;Too much exploitation could promote rigidity and optimization in a local niche, and too much exploration may result in, for e.g. a person becoming ‘jack of all trades, but master of none’. Here also the concept of satisficing is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><strong>*Real world decisions may have unintended&nbsp;consequence(Merton, 1936)</strong>, particularly in domains of many interacting agents. E.g. The Hawthorne effect(Wickström and Bendix, 2000), Cobra Effect(Warczak Jr, 2020), etc. The unintended consequences are the result of complexity, and inability of decision makers to understand and anticipate the emergent realities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decisions may directly affect other people in the network</strong>. Further, people in one's network affects his/her decision making and are in-turn affected by decisions of other agents(Christakis and Fowler, 2007; Edelenbos and Klijn, 2007; Sadovykh et al, 2015; Ingold and Leifeld, 2016) 
<br>.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*<em>&nbsp;</em>Real world complex contexts may not have clear measures of performance or success.</strong> It may be absent, conflicting or vague. Who can say person x made better fatherly decision for his child than person y. It is totally relative. Even the output, i.e. the child's success may or mayn't have anything to do with the parenting decision in a long run.&nbsp; This is not to say that there is not measurable performance in real world; there are. In domains where performance can be objectively measured, such measures drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, it is possible that networks, people or society drive success"(Barabási, 2018). Success is thus a collective endeavor, independent from individual performance. Besides performance, success requires building trust and reputation in order to shape others’ perceptions regarding one’s achievements(Day, 2019).&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>* <strong>Real world decisions are not just individual driven but distributed(Rapley, 2008</strong>; <strong>Schneeweiss,2012;Hutchins and Klausen, 1996):</strong>&nbsp;Decision making in the real world is distributed across various stakeholders(eg. Investors, co-founder, family), institutions(government agencies, partner companies), artifacts(software, notebook, Mobile) etc. A real world example is patient and doctor decision making, in which both patient and doctor have a legitimate investment in the treatment decision; hence
both declare treatment preferences, the rationale for such preference, etc while trying to build consensus on&nbsp; the appropriate treatment to apply’(Charles et al, 1997, 1999). In real world contexts like entrepreneurship there are multiple stakeholders with diverse and conflicting beliefs, preferences, and goals. This idea is enacted in the "Crazy Quilt Principle" of effectuation(Sarasvathy, 2009), were&nbsp;partnerships determines, to a great extent, which product or market the company will eventually end up entering or creating.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decision problems are Interactive and dynamic:</strong> In a complex domain, decision makers(entrepreneurs or managers) are not confronted with
problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. These problems are labelled by Ackoff as messes(Ackoff 1978; Bennet et al, 2008).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>*Real world decisions involve and active role for emotions</strong>(Hermalin and Isen, 2008; )<strong>:</strong> Emotion is an intrinsic part human decision making in real context.&nbsp;Research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and sometimes beneficial drivers of decision making(Lerner et al. 2015). Many scholars now view emotions as one of the dominant drivers of most meaningful decisions in life. This is well observed in entrepreneurship also(Foo, 2011; Cardon et al , 2005; Arpiainen et al, 2013).<br>
<br><br><strong>*Real world decision are path dependent(</strong>Koch et al, 2009;&nbsp;<strong>Bindler and Hjalmarsson, 2019)</strong>: Path dependence means that where we go next depends not
only on where we are now, but also upon where we have been. History matters(Liebowitz and Margolis, 1999). Our decisions of the past and present will influence the future decision landscape, opening up some choices, and constraining others. In the same way, It is also influenced and framed by path dependence of others.

<br>* <strong>Real world decisions and success are influenced by timing: </strong>The right timing is one of the most important aspect of decision making in complexity and it is true in entrepreneurship context too(Wadhwani et al, 2020). According to Bill Gross(2008), the single biggest reason why startups succeed is timing. Since complex domains exhibit dynamics of interaction and evolution (&amp; co-evolution) the opportunity structure changes all the time.We must act when evolutionary potential of other systems around us are primed perfectly for a change. E.g. Facebook was started when a basic infrastructure was already evolved enough to support it, like internet, connectivity(user base), previous models that showed the way(orkut, myspace, etc.)&nbsp;<br><br><strong>* Real world decisions may be impulsive.</strong>&nbsp;Most human decisions in everyday life is not based on elaborate planning and research. Even in significant life decisions people may rely more on emotions and impulsiveness. Simple heuristics are the most preferred decision making device human beings use, and it mostly work(Gigerenzer, 2008). Studies have proven that a substantive entrepreneurial behaviors may also occur without ex-ante reasoning (Wiklund, 2019). According to Lerner et al(2018), non-deliberative impulse-driven behavioral logics can also be the basis for business venturing.<br><br><strong>* Real world decisions may be based on intuition:</strong> Researchers have discovered and acknowledged that decision makers in real world decision contexts relies heavily on intuition&nbsp;<em>(e.g.,&nbsp;</em>Klein, 2015;<em>&nbsp;</em>Gigerenzer and Murray, 2015; Kruglanski and Gigerenzer, 2011<em>)</em>.&nbsp; Further, according to to William Duggan(2013), decision makers may also use different types of intuition, namely; ordinary(every day), expert(fast judgement based on experience and practice), and strategic(a flash of insight that works in new situations).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*Real world decisions are based on selective perception and use of information</strong>(Dearborn and Simon, 1958; Walsh, 1988; Beyer et al, 1997)<strong>; </strong>There is always far more information in our objective environments than we can perceive or attend to. Thus, perceptions must be strongly guided by anticipations. As March and Simon (1958) noted, under conditions of complexity and imperfect information, decisions are made on the basis of selective perception and identification with  sub-goals. <br><br><br><br><strong>*Real world decisions may have heterogeneous reasons;</strong>&nbsp;Bringing all of it together, it is absolutely clear that real world decisions are massively complex and it can have a lot of different dimensions. This make it difficult to pinpoint specific causes because you can only see the dimensions that you are looking. Thus it can be, cognitive biases (Stanovich &amp; West, 2008), past experience(Juliusson et al, 2005), escalation of commitment(Sleesman et al, 2012), age and individual differences(Bruin et al, 2007), belief in personal relevance (Acevedo, &amp; Krueger, 2004), etc. To conclude, an economics model driven view of decisions historically assumed the existence of a rational decision maker(Brzezicka and Wiśniewski, 2014). But in real world complex contexts, decisions are often not what they appear to be. A decision presented as a technical decision may in fact be tactical, political and strategic, or egocentric, emotional and personal, or any or all of them, or more.<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">In the previous chapters, I have demonstrated why entrepreneurship is a complex decision domain by examining some of the features of entrepreneurial complexity. This chapter is about the expertise dimension of complexity with reference to entrepreneurship.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Expertise under complexity
<br></strong>
<br>According to Kahnemann &amp; Klein (2009) two conditions must be satisfied for a judgment to be recognized as coming form expertise(expert intuition); First, the environment must provide adequately valid cues to the nature of the situation. Second is that people must have an opportunity to learn the relevant cues. The determination of whether intuitive judgments can be trusted thus requires an examination of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the opportunity that the judge has had to learn the regularities of that environment. A crucial conclusion is that, skilled intuitions will only develop in an environment of sufficient regularity, which provides valid cues to the situation.&nbsp;Thus, If an environment provides valid cues, prolonged practice opportunity with rapid and unequivocal feedback,---skill and expert intuition will eventually develop in individuals of sufficient talent. Such an environment also helps true experts develop skills to know when they don’t know something, something which non-experts certainly do not know(Kruger and Dunning, 1999). 
<br>
<br>Other scholars(before Kahnemann &amp; Klein, 2009) have also tried to bring out this case. For example, James Shanteau (1992) used the classification of Type 1 Type 2 domains to analyse the complexity and learnability of various environments. Hogarth's(2001) concept of kind and wicked learning environments is another model representing similar idea. He described wicked as situations in which feedback in the form of outcomes of actions or observations is poor, misleading, or even missing. In contrast, in kind learning environments, feedback links outcomes directly to the appropriate actions or judgments and is both accurate and plentiful. 
<br><br>
<br><strong>Expertise in entrepreneurship.</strong><br>
<br><strong>First of all,</strong> any effort to understand expertise in a complex domain like entrepreneurship is by itself complex. Every single issues in question may include heterogeneous mix of problems and domains(e.g. simple, complicated, complex and chaotic parts, OR/AND Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Psychology, etc.), all of which require different frame-sets for understanding. 
<br>
<br><strong>Secondly,</strong>&nbsp;scholars may argue that entrepreneurship is a low validity domain(Kahneman and Klein, 2009) where genuine expertise is not possible. To have genuine expertise to develop, the domains must be of high validity. i.e. “Skilled intuitions will only develop in an environment of sufficient regularity, which provides valid cues to the situation”(Kahneman and Klein, 2009). This feature was also further stressed by a review by Shanteau(1992) which confirmed the Importance of predictable environments and opportunities to learn them, in-order to develop real expertise. To Kahneman and Klein(2009) prolonged
practice and feedback that is both rapid and unequivocal are necessary conditions for expertise, provided by&nbsp;predictable environments.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Thirdly,</strong> deliberate practice may not work in complex domain like entrepreneurship. An expert is ‘someone who has attained a high level of performance in the domain as a result of years of experience’ (Foley and Hart, 1992; Saraswathy, 2008) ) and deliberate practice (Ericsson et al., 1993). But in recent scholarly works, it has been observed that deliberate practice may not guarantee better performance in extremely complex domains. A 2014 meta-analysis(Macnamara et al, 2014) has shown that deliberate practice only explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. This further demonstrates a low connection between deliberate practice and performance in complex unstructured domains.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Fourthly</strong>, expertise in complex social domains are distributed(Edwards, 2010). It is not necessary that an entrepreneurs must be an expert in finance, accounting, programming, law, etc. Such expertise is distributed(and or extended) across various individuals(lawyer, doctor) institutions(law enforcement, companies) and artifacts(tools, software). etc. It is not even necessary that the entrepreneur know the entrepreneurial core activities. He can still win in-case he is in the right high network place(e.g. Harvard, Stanford,etc.), get good people to mentor and work(e.g. Facebook case of Sean Parker, Peter Thiel), get access to specialized institutions(e.g. YC in the case of Dropbox), have a rich family to support, etc. <strong><em>He can also fail despite all of this(see next).</em></strong><br>
<br><br><strong>Fifthly,</strong> complex domains like entrepreneurship are subjected to various complexity laws like power laws, Mathew effects, reputation effects, ecosystem-embedded-preferential-attachment, etc. This&nbsp;invalidates success as a metric of expertise.&nbsp;Core events in complex system like entrepreneurship never repeats in its originality, feedback is delayed, and since complex systems are governed by power laws, small things(e.g. Harvard dorm Facebook) can result in huge success, and resource rich interventions can fail(google plus). A tangent is that the emergent property of a system may not be the result of the expertise of a particular agent or agents, but because of the dynamics of whole system co-evolving with the ecosystem as a whole. This may prevent us from establishing any valid causal relationship between expertise and performance in a domain like entrepreneurship. Thus in complexity, high performance may not guarantee success, in that, the success of an individual does not depend uniquely on the quality of performance (Barabási, 2018).&nbsp;<br>
<br><strong>Sixthly,</strong> If anyone become successful in such a system she(he) acquires what i call ecosystem embedded accumulated advantage(e.g. paypal mafia), a entrepreneurial Mathew effect which make it easy for the agent to be successful in any substituent pursuits. This make it difficult to identify causation behind any success. That also makes it difficult to compare a successful entrepreneurial agent with new startup founders. <br>
<br><strong>Finally,</strong> all of the above issues leads to the idea that entrepreneurship, at-least the core aspect of it involves&nbsp;<strong>"Complex indeterminate causation”</strong>(Hoffman et al., 2011) which represents a situation in which rational individual decision-making is hindered by an inability to discern a clear chain of causality. “In real-world settings, the evidence for causation is typically too ambiguous to permit valid reasoning, so [rationality] is not a generally useful standard” (Hoffman et al., 2011, p. 419). <br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Adjoined with technology entrepreneurship boom and the glamorization of entrepreneurship as an ideal career choice, there has been a growing interest among various actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem to provide/get valid guidance in entrepreneurial action. This is also because many have grown increasingly skeptical of the usefulness of traditional methods like business plans. Both scholars and practitioners have responded to this demand by suggesting a variety of <strong>heuristics</strong>(Manimala, 1992) and <strong>prescriptive models</strong>(Mansoori, 2017). 
<br>
<br><strong>Entrepreneurial heuristics</strong> includes thumb-rules guiding the decisions involved in the start-up and management of a new venture. E.g. Product-market fit, Do things that does not scale, 1000 true fans(or 100), Mom Test, Jobs to be done, etc. 
<br>
<br><strong>Prescriptive methods</strong> or models are principles of thought and action that guide the theoretical and practical aspects of human action(Mansoori 2017; Romme and Endenburg 2006). Some examples are; Business Planning (Sahlman, 1997, Delmar and Shane, 2003), Contingency planning (Honig, 2004, Marc Gruber 2017), Discovery-driven planning (McGrath and MacMillan, 1995), Probe-and-Learn approach(Lynn et al., 1996), Lean start-up approach (Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011), Theory Based View(Felin et al, 2020), Disciplined Entrepreneurship. Sull (2004), Design thinking, Effectual entrepreneurship (Sarasvathy, 2001), etc.
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Weakness of existing prescriptive models.
<br></strong>
<br>According to Mansoori(2017), prescriptive methods of entrepreneurship have been criticized for their lack of rigor and relevance by various scholars(Wood 2000, Heitmann 2014, Frank and Landström 2016, Arend et al. 2015, Wolf and Rosenberg 2012). Scholars have also shown that entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and why it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science(McKelvey, 2004). This is a major challenge because complex systems are affected by the emergent property, evolutionary dynamics, non-linearity, etc. In complex systems like entrepreneurship past behavior may not predict its future behavior. A small change in any of the initial condition variables can result in a huge difference in the end result. 
<br>
<br><strong><em>I argue that most prescriptive models are reductionist in origin and most are ignoring (or ignorant) of complexity by omission or prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>Most of the models listed above are originated or validated by using traditional linear scientific methods, transforming the results into prescriptive insights(Denyer et al. 2008) for entrepreneurs, suggesting how should they act. According to a study by Kuckertz and Mandl (2013) regression analysis is rated as the most fundamental method in entrepreneurship research scholars should be familiar with, but is inappropriate for studying complex systems. Scholars have also identified complexity in entrepreneurship in the form of <strong>power laws</strong>, suggesting for the use of complexity informed methods(Crawford, Aguinis, Lichtenstein, Davidsson, and McKelvey, 2015). 
<br>
<br>Another source is anecdotal and idiosyncratic experiences of ecosystem actors like entrepreneurs or institutions like VC's or accelerators. A widely used example that fits the category is the lean startup(Ries 2011), which is often criticized for its explicit demonstration of survivorship bias(which is a bias of focusing on a successful sample and claiming it to be representative of the entire group).  
<br>
<br><strong>Following are some of the significant weaknesses of existing methods/models when considering the nature entrepreneurial complexity.
<br></strong>
<br><strong>1. Ignoring context
<br></strong>
<br>Entrepreneurship is still a highly decontextualized research field, which is also reflected in the popular prescriptive models we use, and also one-size-fits-all advice we give to entrepreneurs. Most of the dominant perspectives still assume that entrepreneurship is the same all over the world, regardless of historical, cultural, institutional, social, and spatial contexts. This is also clear from the growing homogeneity in mentorship, accelerator, and entrepreneurship education programs. This has been described as a McDonaldization of entrepreneurship education(Hytti, 2018, Brentnall. et. al 2021), a highly standardized&nbsp; menu of activities is served up for student consumption, such as competitions and mini-company creation. According to Baker and Welter, the messiness and complexity of entrepreneurship derive from contextual questions like; Who is driving it?; A community? A family? An individual?. What are the different types of social networks invoked?; friends, family, community, various stakeholders, etc. These are embedded within, and in turn, affect regulatory, and normative contexts at the community, regional, national, and broader levels. Thus entrepreneurship can only be understood within its historical, temporal,
institutional, spatial, and social contexts, as these contexts provide individuals with opportunities and set boundaries for their actions. Most prescriptive models promote a model-centric view of the world and are not flexible or intelligent enough to capture crucial contextual insights.
<br>
<br><strong>2. Lacks Evolvability
<br></strong>
<br>Evolution is a fundamental feature of nature, biology, and human social life. In comparison to biological evolution, the human social system is capable of adapting to change at a faster rate. It is particularly significant in the case of entrepreneurship in that entrepreneurs often act as catalysts of social evolution and also are affected by the smallest of changes in the environment. One of the major sources of weakness in existing entrepreneurship models is the lack of evolvability. Once proposed and written down the model never changes. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in the entrepreneurship domain are self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it gives a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity.
<br><br>
<br><strong>3. Fixation Errors and Design Fixation
<br></strong>
<br>According to De Keyser and Woods (1990), many critical real-world human problem-solving situations take place in dynamic event-drivers environments, where the evidence comes over time and situations can change rapidly. In these situations, people must amass and integrate, uncertain, incomplete, and changing evidence. A major source of human error in dynamic domains seems to be a failure to revise situation assessment as new evidence comes in. I argue that most of the commonly suggested methods like a business plan and lean-startup are highly vulnerable to what Keyser and Woods call Fixation errors. Prescriptive models are especially vulnerable to another type of fixation called design fixation(Jansson and Smith,1991), which refers to the designer’s inability to consider multiple strategies to formulate and solve a design need. It is the direct result of knowledge representation, with human knowledge argued to be organized categorically. These categories are defined by prototypes that exemplify the category(Condoor &amp; LaVoie, 2007). Since linear approaches like Lean startup and business model canvas etc. are based on structured and step-by-step processes (Liedtka &amp; Ogilvie, 2011), they may add to the rigidity and hence may act as counterproductive in dynamic high-stress environments. This rigidity may lead to design fixation(Garbuio et al., 2018, Jansson &amp; Smith, 1991, p.4).
<br><br><strong>4. Structure and Issue of Agency
<br></strong>
<br>Agency is described as an individual’s ability at any given point in time, to act independently in order to change the internal or external environment (Bandura, 2001; Campbell, 2009; Hitlin &amp; Elder, 2007). According to Bruno Latour(1996), once designed and introduced into the interactional scene by humans, texts, artifacts, and objects of any kind make sense and have an agency on their own. I argue that most of the prescriptive models have agency of their own, and are designed to highjack entrepreneurial agency by providing a model-centric view of the world. Commitment to one-size-fits-all models may
result in the agent's evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential being seriously compromised.  Further, In the descriptive sense, most of the prescriptive models assume that entrepreneurs possess excessive powers of agency(Kitching, J., &amp; Rouse, J.2020). This is evident from the inherent assumption that regular entrepreneurs are using exactly what the model prescribes, almost like an algorithmic precision. In the practical sense, the models take control of entrepreneur's agency by prescribing things to do and think. It is suggestive of what to see, what to do, what not to do, etc.
<br><br><strong>5. Local optima, Bounded rationality, and Local search
<br></strong>
<br>Research has found that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does to established firms and that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice(Simon, 1955) prematurely across many decisions(Cohen et al 2018). Most of the prescriptive models assume(by omission or prescription) that the entrepreneurs are able to review all information and make a rational decision in their best interest. Research on human bounded rationality suggests these assumptions are wrong. Another dimension of this issue is that entrepreneurs generally start their venture with a preference to ‘local search’, whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge. This leads to the identification of local optima rather than global optima(Keinz &amp; Prügl, 2010; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001; Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996). An empirical study done by Shane(2000) has also shown that entrepreneurs tend to identify opportunities that were either already known to them in the past or are closely related to their existing stock of knowledge. This phenomenon is also known as local search bias (Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001). The local search behavior is of inevitable importance but the problem is that focusing on existing knowledge and expertise alone can Impede the entrepreneur from exploring distant solutions(Helfat, 1994; Fleming &amp; Sorenson, 2004). I argue that most of the existing entrepreneurship models reinforce and augment bounded rationality and local search behavior. They are optimized for local search behavior in which they may make entrepreneurs more susceptible to being blinded by their own bounded rationality. For a design to be sustainable it must acknowledge that the end-users are fallible humans with bounded rationality. It must take into account cognitive limitations, bias, and dispositions. Models must anticipate the potential issues that could arise from bounded rationality and compensate for it with built-in design solutions.
<br>
<br><strong>6. In exclusion To others by omission or prescription.
<br></strong><br>In complexity and evolution, heterogeneity is an asset. The more the relevant elements of variation present(requisite variety ) in a system, the more resilient and evolvable a system will become. Despite that, most models are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one. It is often pitched as better than the previous one. E.g. Plan Vs Lean startup, effectuation Vs causation, Theory-based view vs Lean. Using the antecedent as a frame to marginally improve the model is also the standard practice. While this is the reality, studies have shown that real entrepreneurs don't behave according to the dictum of any prescriptive models. Fisher(2012) for example investigated behavior underlying the venture founding process using effectuation, bricolage, and causation has found that entrepreneurs often use elements of all the 3 theoretical models and that there were no cases in which only the behaviors associated with causation were responsible for the development of the venture. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) in their analysis stressed the possibility of using multiple methods complementing each other, which is a standard practice in weather prediction(ensemble models). Sarasvathy (2001) also asserted the point that both causation and effectuation are integral parts of human reasoning that can occur simultaneously, overlapping and intertwining over different contexts of decisions and actions” (p. 245). Real-world decisions in a complex adaptive system cannot be understood with linear thinking or binaries. Since it is impossible to know various emergent decision contexts beforehand, it is always ideal to design solutions for such variables and contingencies. That means not excluding ideas, models and theories, etc by prescription or omission. </p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Since entrepreneurship is a complex domain, proposed design solutions must recognize complexity as a core design challenge. It must also consider the disposition and bounded rationality of the decision making agent in question. Following my analysis of entrepreneurial complexity and weakness of contemporary thinking, I propose the incorporation of some important dispositional capabilities necessary for a sustainable model for entrepreneurial action. 
<br>
<br>They;
<br>
<br>*Must begin with the right view: The right worldview(Dent, 1999) is necessary precondition to effective design. If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. 
<br>
<br>*Must acknowledge and promote self-organisation: Self-organisation(Heylighen, 2008) refers to the feature of systems that appear to organize themselves without external direction, manipulation, or control. This promotes ecologically grounded evolution and dynamics. A sustainable, complexity friendly model must promote self-organization instead of one-size fits all models, rigid prescriptions or top down order.
<br>
<br>*Must promote exploration: While self-organization may promote local optimization, the dispositional capability for exploration(Gupta, et al, 2006) is necessary to facilitate the journey towards global optima. A sustainable complexity friendly model must have the capability for continues multidimensional exploration.  
<br>
<br>*Must promote diversity(Page, 2010) integration(Martin, 2009) and inclusiveness(Pless and Maak, 2004) : Decisions in a complex domain like entrepreneurship cannot be understood with linear thinking or binaries. Since it is impossible to know various emergent decision contexts before hand, it is always ideal to design solutions for such variables and contingencies. That means a design must promote diversity and not exclude ideas, models, theories, etc., by prescription or omission.
<br>
<br>*Must be contextually adaptive: Every context is unique, and thus we need solutions that are adaptable and usable for various contexts, as it emerges. Adaptive systems involves designing the elements of a system to find by themselves the solution of the problem. Like this, when the problem changes, the elements are able to dynamically find a new solution. We can say that such a system self-organizes(Gershenson, 2017).
<br>
<br>*Must provide evolvability to the agent and must have evolvability of its own: Evolution and evolvability(Juarrero, 2015; Pigliucci, 2008; ScienceDaily, 2013) are a fundamental feature of nature, biology and human social life. A sustainable entrepreneurship framework must have evolutionary potential of its own, and also must enable evolvability to the entrepreneurial agents.
<br>
<br>*Must protect agency from hijack: Prescriptive models have agency of its own, and are designed to hijack entrepreneurial agency by providing a model centric view of the world. Commitment to one-size-fits-all models may result in the agents evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential being seriously compromised. Thus, a sustainable complexity friendly model must protect and promote appropriate levels of entrepreneurial agency(Garud and Karnøe, 2003) and autonomy.
<br>
<br>*Must acknowledge the dispositional state, including ignorance and weaknesses:  Most of the existing entrepreneurship models reinforce and augment bounded rationality. A sustainable complexity friendly model must acknowledge the possibility for bounded rationality, ignorance and weaknesses. It must have inbuilt dispositional capabilities like distributed sense-making(Weick, 2005; Fisher, 2012) and descriptive self-awareness(Snowden, 2002), etc. to continually scan inwards and outwards for issues like ignorance, weakness or bounded rationality. 
<br>
<br>*Must encapsulate various complexity friendly functional dispositions: A complexity friendly model must also be designed with a usability perspective in mind. It must encapsulate various complexity friendly functional dispositions(above listed) into a single framework so that an ecology of ideas, in its dynamics, will transfer to the users, not just one or two ideas.
<br>
<br>*Must strive forward as a continues work in progress in a perpetual construction(Prigogine, 1997): Once proposed and written down, most models or prescriptive methods never changes. This is a weakness when considering the speed of radical changes happening around us. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in entrepreneurship domain are designed to be self aggrand izing and self-perpetuating. A sustainable complexity friendly model must have the capability to change itself according to challenges.  
<br>
<br>In the following part I will demonstrate the design of this framework as a complexity based design framework to aid entrepreneurial action. This include;
<br>
<br>1. The right world view: Deep ecology view(Arne Naess, 1973) embodies the logic that "everything is connected to everything else". Entrepreneurship is a complex adaptive system in the complex entrepreneurial ecology which is part of deep ecology.  
<br>
<br>2.Self-organization(Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r 2003): Using effectuation as a self-organization logic, or effectual self-organization.
<br>
<br>3. Constraints: Using constraints to bias the self organization towards various contextual and functional dispositions above mentioned.</p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">World view of the framework
<br>
<br>The right world view(Dent, 1999) is necessary precondition for sustainable and effective design. If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. As discussed previously, entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science(McKelvey, 2004). Despite this reality most entrepreneurship models and perspectives are reductionist in its origin, prescription, or omission. To solve this weakness this framework adopts an ecological world view, i.e a complex, dynamic, connected and evolving ecology.  
<br>  
<br>In-order to understand the ecological view, lets first go through the existing world views and few alternatives. After that I will introduce ecological view to show how it is different for other world views.  
<br>
<br>1. Single Model world view: This is the world view based on a single model, tool, or method which assumes superiority over all other. This can be equated to what Charlie Munger(1994)calls, “Man with a Hammer” syndrome, which is the idea that if an individual has only one tool or model(e.g. hammer), he'll approach all of his problems with the same solution, i.e. a hammer. For a man with a hammer, everything around him will seem like a nail. Most models in entrepreneurship comes under this category. They are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one and are pitched as better that the previous one. E.g. Lean startup(Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011) Vs Business planning, Theory based view(Felin et al, 2020) vs Lean, etc. Using the antecedent as a frame to marginally improve the model is also the standard practice. 
<br>
<br>2. Multiple-Model Ensembles: This world view suggests complimentary use of multiple models or methods. This is the same idea as suggested by Scott Page(2018) and Ensemble forecasting model(Leutbecher and Palmer, 2008) used in weather prediction. In entrepreneurship multiple model world view can be found is many scholarly works. For e.g. Sarasvathy(2001)stressed on the importance of both effectuation and causation. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) suggested using multiple methods complimenting each other. This world view is by default inclusive of the previous one. 
<br>
<br>
<br>3. Cognitive-Diversity world view: This world view suggests using of not only formal models or methods but all kinds of cognitive diversity. E.g. Models, methods, theories, heuristics, etc. Scott Page defines Cognitive Diversity as “Differences in information, knowledge, representations, mental models, and heuristic, to better outcomes on specific tasks such as problem solving, predicting, and innovating(Page, 2017,14-15)".  To me, the weakness of this view is in its cognitive reductionism. Even though this world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones, any cognitive alone worldview can be criticized for lack of ecological basis(Gibson, 1979; Varela et al., 1991; Clark, 1997). 
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Holistic Diversity worldview: Apart from cognitive diversity, Page(2017) also talks about identity diversity, i.e. the differences in race, gender, age, physical capabilities, and sexual orientation. There are other frames to view diversities like; Biodiversity, which can be defined as variety in all forms of life—from genes to species to ecosystems(Wood, 1997); Cultural diversity, that can be defined as differences, such as in language, religion, dress and  moral codes that exist between people according to race and ethnicity (Leveson et al, 2009; Kossek and Zonia, 1993). Tool diversity; that suggests the use of multiple tools for the same task to increase output accuracy by reducing systematic errors (Song et al, 2018). Artifact diversity refers to the number of different classes of artifacts and their relative proportions(Smallwood et al, 2018). In short this world view suggests the existence of not only Cognitive-Diversity, but also, all other kinds of diversities, i.e. diversity in people, biology, identity, networks, information sources, relational-expertise, institutions, culture, location, specialization, artifacts, tools, etc.  This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. 
<br>
<br>
<br>5. Ecological View or Deep ecology view: This includes a continues effort to capture the true ecological realty in its dynamics. In addition to the previously listed holistic diversity, this view is inclusive of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, interaction, etc. Complexity involves features and interactive dynamics as in a complex adaptive system. The idea of evolution suggest that existing elements interact, evolve, co-evolve into new diversities, variations etc. It must also involve cumulative cultural evolution(and intelligence) as proposed by human evolution studies . In addition, an ecology is connected, hence no clear local global separation is possible. This is particularly significant in human social ecology. Finally, ecological view sanctions the use of a contextualized sense-making that suggest that every human context is an emergent property and hence each context has unique types of characters. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. 
<br>
<br>
<br> The framework's worldview: 3 parts
<br>
<br>1. Deep ecology(Arne Naess, 1973; Capra, 1996)
<br>
<br>Practical or working definition of ecology can change with unit of observation, domains or problems, etc. Thus, ecology can be defined in a biological perspective as the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment, while for e.g. if we are looking at the infectious disease ecology like COVID, It has a more refined emphasis on the study of the interactions between pathogens, their host organisms, and the environment(Amman et al. 2017). Similarly, the term social ecology in the context of child health and well-being would mean a nested arrangement of family, school, neighborhood, and community contexts in which children grow up(Earls and Carlson, 2001). Like wise, information ecology may mean the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment(Pekkarinen et al, 2020). Further, ecology can also be of a subdomain(problem or topic), like for e.g. the phenomena of human suffering which comes under mental health. Thus, “ecology” can refer to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him and her(Jadhav, 2015). 
<br>
<br>With this practical understanding, this framework operates in the entrepreneurial ecology, where multiple agents, institutions, artifacts, problems, etc, interacts with each other to form a complex adaptive interdependent system that emerges in the human socio-cognitive-material space. Even though the framework(and by implication the users of the framework) operates primarily in the entrepreneurial ecology, the world view it beholds is "deep ecology". This means, entrepreneurial ecology is part of deep ecology and everything is connected to everything else.
<br>
<br>The philosophical school of deep ecology was founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess(1973). He developed the concept by distinguishing it with what he calls shallow ecology, which is human-centered. Shallow ecology "views humans as above or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental, or "use," value to nature.  Deep ecology does not separate humans--or anything else-from the natural environment. It sees the world not as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic value of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life"(Capra, 1996).
<br>
<br>According to Capra(1996, p.3), ecological wordview grew out of an awareness that contemporary problems cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are interconnected and interdependent. He uses the term ‘deep ecology’ to highlight the inescapable connections and  mutual influences among the human, natural, physical, and constructed environments implicit in this view of reality(Mitchell and Sackney, 2011, p.2). Further, the deep ecological perspective can be viewed as a perspective to complexity that involves properties like holistic interconnection, interdependence, heterogeneous agents, non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, emergent property, self-organisation, dynamics of evolution, attractor behaviour, power Laws, open exchange or energy and information with their environment, etc. 
<br>
<br>
<br> 2. Self Organization 
<br>
<br>Second important part of this worldview is Self-organisation. This is about seeing entrepreneurs, industries, economies, etc as self-organizing systems. As discussed in part 1, It refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level(Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r 2003; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. In self-organization, the final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and design, and is not known a priori(De Roo, 2016). This can be contrasted with the top-down approaches where planning precedes implementation, and the desired final system is known by design.
<br>
<br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(1) where I will introduce the theory of effectual self-organization 
<br>
<br>3. Constraints
<br>
<br>Self-organization happens under various constraints. Constraints in general sense may be taken as restrictive. But it is important to understand that constraints are enabling too. Order in human life is primarily created through constraints. "It is not something which merely limits possibilities, constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced”(Cilliers, 2001). 
<br>
<br>According to Lili Gatlin(1971), In a system, the probability that something will happen vs. something else happening is due to constraints. E.g. Our skeleton system constraints the self-organization so that we get humanly shape. Scholars like Kauffman(1993) also emphasized this role of constraints on the direction of evolution caused by self-organization. 
<br>
<br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(ll) where I will introduce two types of constraints(context free &amp; context sensitive) as a dynamic and adaptive design solution to aid the effectuation self-organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

This promotes ecologically grounded evolution and dynamics.
<br>
<br>I consider effectuation(Sarasvathy, 2001) as an ideal praxis for entrepreneurial self-organization. This is because; 
<br>
<br>1. It is compatible with many of the rules of self-organizing complex systems. Which are, bottom-up, local interactions, co-adaptation, co-evolution, distributed agency &amp; intelligence, etc(will be explained). 
<br>
<br>2.Further, a particular strength of effectuation theory is that it takes context into account when exploring decision making(Dacin et al, 2011).
<br>
<br>3. It is also compatible with other methods and also the strengths of effectuation on a theoretical level is well recognized(Mansoori and Lackeus, 2019).

The concept was further developed by many scholarly works like Farley and Clark in 1954 to describe learning and adaptation mechanisms, Von Foerster,1960, that a self-organizing dynamical system possesses some stable structures, Haken, 1977, global cooperation of elements of a dynamical system – resulting in it assuming an attractor state – self-organization, Haken with his theory of synergetics, Prigogine with his notion of dissipative structures, Kauffman(1993) emphasized the role of constraints on the direction of evolution (mostly of the living), caused by self-organization. 
<br>
<br>The application of Self-Organization later expanded to many different domains; e.g. Cybernetics (von Foerster, 1960; Ashby, 1962; Heylighen and Joslyn, 2001), Mathematics (Lendaris, 1964), Studies of learning and adaptation (Conrad, Kohonen), Thermodynamics (Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977), Systems far from equilibrium (Prigogine, Haken), Chaos theory (Thom, Mandelbrot), Biology (Eigen, Rosen ; Camazine et al., 2003; Feltz et al., 2006), Neurophysiology (von der Mahlsburg, Linsker), Cognitive science (von Foerster, Maturana and Varela), Computer science (Heylighen and Gershenson, 2003; Mamei et al., 2006; Kohonen, 2000), Information theory(Shalizi, 2001), Evolution of language (de Boer, 1999; Steels, 2003), Software engineering (Wooldridge et al., 2000; Zambonelli et al., 2003), Electrical engineering (Ramamoorthy et al., 1993), and Collaborative support (Jones et al., 1994). 
<br>
<br>As I have already discussed in part 1, Self-organization refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level(Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r 2003; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. The final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and design, and is not known a priori(De Roo, 2016). We can find self-organisation as a important character of market, business and entrepreneurship. For example, we can see the venture as self-organized system emerged to satisfy customer demands. 
<br>
<br>This framework views self-organization as a fundamental feature of complex adaptive systems like entrepreneurship. I argue that the theory of effectuation is an ideal praxis for entrepreneurial self-organization. With this in mind, In the following part of this chapter I will discuss:
<br>
<br>1. Theory of effectuation
<br>
<br>2. Paul Cillier's General attributes of self-organizing systems with reference to effectuation. 
<br>
<br>
<br>1. Theory of Effectuation 
<br>
<br>The theory of effectuation suggests that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs adopt a decision logic that is different to that explained by a traditional, more rational model of entrepreneurship called “causation”. It is described by Sarasvathy (2008) as “a logic of entrepreneurial expertise, a dynamic and interactive process of creating new artifacts in the world.” (Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005; Sarasvathy, 2008). According to her, a causal logic is based on the premise: ‘To the extent we can predict the future, we can control it.’ An effectual logic is based on the premise: ‘To the extent we can control the future, we do not need to predict it’(Saraswathy, 2009).
<br>
<br>Effectuation dictates that in highly uncertain and dynamic environments, target customers can only be defined ex post through whoever buys a product or service. Goals change, are shaped and constructed over time, and are sometimes formed by chance. Instead of focusing on goals, the entrepreneur exerts control over the available set of means—the things over which the entrepreneur has control(Fisher, 2012). 
<br> 
<br>Saraswathy developed the theory of effectuation from her research on expert entrepreneurs. In that she found following process elements of entrepreneurial expertise(Saraswathy, 2008. p.15).
<br>
<br>1. Expert entrepreneurs begin with who they are, what they know and whom they know, and immediately start taking action and interacting with other people. 
<br>
<br>2. They focus on what they can do and do it, without worrying much about what they ought to do. 
<br>
<br>3. Some of the people they interact with self-select into the process by making commitments to the venture. 
<br>
<br>4. Each commitment results in new means and new goals for the venture. 
<br>
<br>5. As resources accumulate in the growing network, constraints begin to accrete. The constraints reduce possible changes in future goals and restrict who may or may not be admitted into the stakeholder network. 
<br>
<br>6. Assuming the stakeholder accumulation process does not prematurely abort, goals and network concurrently converge into a new  market and a new firm.
<br>
<br>She further adds that, at each step of the process, expert entrepreneurs use the following principles(Saraswathy, 2008, p.15).
<br>
<br>1. The bird-in-hand principle 
<br>This is a principle of means-driven (as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. 
<br>
<br>2.The affordable-loss principle 
<br>This principle prescribes committing in advance to what one is willing to lose rather than investing in calculations about expected returns to the project. 
<br>
<br>3. The crazy-quilt principle 
<br>This principle involves negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. Furthermore, who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa. 
<br>
<br>4. The lemonade principle 
<br>This principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. 
<br>
<br>5. The pilot-in-the-plane principle 
<br>This principle urges relying on and working with human agency as the prime driver of opportunity rather than limiting entrepreneurial efforts to exploiting exogenous factors such as technological trajectories and socioeconomic trends.
<br>
<br>
<br>2. Paul Cillier's General attributes of self-organizing systems with reference to effectuation. 
<br>
<br>According to Paul Cilliers, "the capacity for self-organisation is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structure spontaneously and adoptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment". To him, different systems that share the property of self-organisation will not necessarily exhibit the same range of characteristics. A living cell can certainly be classified as self-organizing, but its internal structure will be more stable than that of an economic system of a country. An economic system is self-organizing in the sense that it changes its internal structure in response to a large number of factors (money supply, growth rate, political stability, natural disasters, etc.).
<br>
<br>Despite these important differences between various self-organizing, complex systems with different functions, there are shared attributes that conform to the framework of the general model for complex systems. I will attempt to demonstrate the self-organization attributives of effectual entrepreneurship which are parallel to that of the 8 attributes listed by Cilliers.  General attributes of self-organizing systems include the 
<br>following: 
<br>
<br>(i) The structure of the system is not the result of an a priori design, nor is it determined directly by external conditions. It is a result of interaction between the system and its environment. 
<br>
<br>Effectuation is not about top down design, control or delegation for an external agent. It is not based on pre-decided design, nor internal planning. Effectuation is the inverse of causation. Causal models begin with an effect to be created. They seek either to select between means to achieve those effects or to create new means to achieve preselected ends.  
<br>
<br>(ii) The internal structure of the system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment, even if these changes are not regular. 
<br>
<br>The crazy-quilt and lemonade principles of effectuation corresponds to this aspect. The crazy-quilt principle suggests co-evolving and co-adapting with other agents while  negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. A very important stress of Saraswathy is that "Who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa" . Secondly, the lemonade principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. 
<br>
<br>
<br>(iii) Self-organisation is not merely the result of processes like feedback or regulation that can be described linearly. It involves higher-order, nonlinear processes that cannot be modelled by sets of linear differential equations. 
<br>
<br>I argue that the entire effectuation logic is based on adapting to the potentialities of the environment by using it. This cannot be modeled by linear equations. More specifically the lemonade principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. 
<br>
<br>
<br>(iv) Self-organisation is an emergent property of a system as a whole (or of large enough sub-systems). The system’s individual components only operate on local information and general principles. The macroscopic behaviour emerges from microscopic interactions that by themselves have a very meagre information content (only traces). 
<br>
<br>The logic of effectuation acknowledges emergent property(not by explicitly naming it emergent property, but by implication) and its adaptive nature is part of this acknowledgement. Here also the lemonade principle need a stress because it is really the application of how to deal with surprises generated by such emergent property.  Further, even though all of the five core principles( bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane)are based on adaptive logic, in real dynamics we must also take into account two concurrent cycles: expanding means and converging goals. The expanding-means cycle looks for increases in resources; and the Converging goals cycle adapts the goals. "It accretes constraints on the venture that converge into specific goals that get embodied in an effectual artifact over time”(Sarasvathy et al, 2014; Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005, pp. 543–544). According to Saraswathy, "The history of new market creation is full of unusual partnerships leading to the emergence of new networks. Instead of arising naturally as a consequence of existing social networks, several of these seminal relationships began through unplanned encounters or serendipitous events"(Saraswathy, 2008, p.118)
<br>
<br>
<br>(v) Self-organizing systems increase in complexity.....(trimmed). The increase in complexity may also form part of  the explanation why self-organizing systems tend to age. Since these systems are bound by the finite constraints of the physical world, they inevitably become saturated at some point.
<br>
<br>Effectuation acknowledges this increase in complexity. Effectual process begins in effectual adjacent zone. It initiates the process from the means available and by doing the things the entrepreneur can do. The means will expand, goals will change, many stakeholders will join-in bringing their insights in their insights, etc. The effectual cycle is a continues process that scans for changes in core dispositional realities. Further, there is no explicit mentioning of saturation and destruction in effectuation, but since human agency is capable of awareness, it can be solutions can designed to an extend. As the pilot-in-the-plane principle suggest, "we can work with human agency as the prime driver".
<br>
<br>
<br>(vi) Self-organisation is impossible without some form of memory, a point closely related to the previous one. Without memory, the system can do no better than merely mirror the environment. A self-organizing system therefore always has a history...(Trimmed)
<br>
<br>Effectual process involves continues cycle of going back to the dispositional factors like means, goals and direction. This I argue is because the memory of a complex system is embedded in its disposition(position &amp; propensity) itself. It is also distributed across the system. This can also be viewed as system that augments its behaviour with an associative memory of its own attractors(Watson, 2011). In entrepreneurship, attarctors can be many things like intentions, money, product, customers, stakeholders, vision statement, etc. This is also why Complex systems like entrepreneurship are path dependent(Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995; Tripsas &amp; Gavetti, 2000), and subject to Imprinting(Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007; Milanov &amp; Fernhaber, 2009). 
<br>
<br>
<br>(vii) Since the self-organizing process is not guided or determined by specific goals, it is often difficult to talk about the function of such a system.  Self-organisation in complex systems cannot be driven by the attempt to perform a function; it is rather the result of an evolutive process whereby a system will simply not survive if it cannot adapt to more complex circumstances. 
<br>
<br>Effectuation absolutely embrace this philosophy. In effectuation, goals are driven by means and other interacting agents. This points to the coevolutionary potential of the entrepreneur and stake-holders both. According to the bird-in-hand principle, effectuation is means-driven (as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. Further, Each stakeholder commitment results in new means and new goals for the venture. 
<br>
<br>
<br>(viii) Similarly, it is not possible to give crudely reductionistic descriptions of self-organising systems. Since microscopic units do not ‘know’ about large-scale effects, while at the same time these effects manifest themselves in collections that do not involve anything besides these microscopic units, the various ‘levels’ of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined.  
<br>
<br>Effectuation is in a way a detour from reductionism existed in entrepreneurship research that focused on few isolated aspects of personality, attitude or other personal or situational observables. This is evident from her comparison of effectuation with her doctoral advisor Herbert Simon's concept of near-decomposable systems(Simon and Ando,1961) where she argues that, "both effectuation and near-decomposability exploit locality and contingency in the evolution of the artifact. Just as effectuation creates rapidly evolving artifacts that leverage the interdependence of parts to exploit locality and contingency, so near-decomposability in the structure of such systems leverages the independence of parts to exploit the same locality and contingency. While effectuation stitches together pieces of entrepreneurial fabric into economic quilts that continue to make sense in an interactive and dynamically changing environment, ND identifies lines of ‘tearing’ so that entrepreneurship as a science of the artificial pieces can be reworked in synchrony with the overall pattern as the needs imposed by the environment change"(Saraswathy, 2008,p.165-166).</p>

<br>
<br>The empirical evidence for effectuation came from the study of expert entrepreneurs conducted by Saraswathy. She contrasts her study on entrepreneurial expertise with entrepreneurial performance that has been traditionally studied either (1) as a set of personality traits of the entrepreneur that explains the success or failure of the firms he or she creates (Llewellyn and Wilson, 2003), or (2) as a set of circumstances or attributes of the project and its environment that contains the seeds of its success or failure (Thornton, 1999). In that, she conducted a cognitive science based study of entrepreneurial expertise using think-aloud verbal protocols. Included in that, a 17-page problem set of 10 typical decisions in a startup firm and had a representative sample of 27 expert entrepreneurs.
<br>
<br>In this framework I am approaching or using effectuation as an action theory/logic for complex domains, particularly in social complexity, not just as possessions of expert entrepreneurs. 
<br>
<br>Following are some reasons; 
<br>
<br>Firstly, I think most of the effectuation principles are universal and has corresponding concepts from complexity science. Herbert Simon also hinted at this aspect and suggested that there might be a connection between effectuation and  Near Decomposibility(Sarasvathy and Simon, 2000). According to him((Saraswathy, 2008), Near Decomposibility is an astonishingly ubiquitous principle in the architecture of rapidly evolving complex systems, and effectuation appears to be a preferred decision model with entrepreneurs who have created high-growth firms, we should be able to link Near Decomposibility to the processes these entrepreneurs use to create and grow enduring firms–whether in an experimental situation or in the real world.(Saraswathy, 2008, p.163). The beauty of effectuation is that Saraswathy in her scientific study, brilliantly identified and encapsulated all of these complexity principles and made it accessible to potential entrepreneurs with simple everyday language. Thus, I believe, using it as complexity based concept may improve the potential and scalability of the concept.
<br>
<br>
<br>Secondly, many scholars may argue that entrepreneurship is a low validity domain(Kahneman and Klein, 2009). To have genuine expertise to develop, the domains must be of high validity. i.e. "Skilled intuitions will only develop in an environment of sufficient regularity, which provides valid cues to the situation"(Kahneman and Klein, 2009). I argue that, while studying expertise of experienced entrepreneurs, she inadvertently discovered the universal laws for operating in low validity, complex uncertain domains. 
<br>
<br>Thirdly, complex domains like entrepreneurship are subjected to various complexity laws like power laws, mathew effects, reputation effects, ecosystem-embedded-preferential-attachment, etc. This may prevent us from establishing any valid causal relationship between expertise and performance in a domain like entrepreneurship. Thus in complexity, high performance may not guarantee success, in that, success of an individual does not depend uniquely on the quality of performance(Barabási, 2018; Barabási and Musciotto, 2019; Yucesoy and Barabási, 2016). 
<br>
<br>
<br>Fourthly, Saraswathy(2008) defined an expert as ‘someone who has attained a high level of performance in the domain as a result of years of experience’ (Foley and Hart, 1992) and deliberate practice (Ericsson et al., 1993). But in recent scholarly works it has been observed that deliberate practice may not guarantee better performance in extremely complex domains. In a 2014 meta-analysis(Macnamara el al, 2014) it has showed that deliberate practice only explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. This further demonstrates low correlation of deliberate practice to performance in complex unstructured domains.
<br>
<br>Fifthly, I believe that, like the personality view of entrepreneurial achievement(McClelland,1951, 1961; Llewellyn and Wilson, 2003), the expertise view may also have some unintented counter-productive effects. It can legitimize the hubris among successful entrepreneurs, and at the same time make the aspiring entrepreneur think that he may require deliberate practice to become a successful entrepreneur, while in-fact success could be the result of complexity effects like power laws, mathew effects, reputation effects, preferential attachment, etc.  
<br>
<br>
<br>Finally, I believe that effectuation is widely applicable in other domains. It has application in complex domains like education, learning, economics, politics, etc. Framing effectuation as a science of action in social complexity will open up a lot of possibility. This also will make the theory more robust and useful. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Effectuation and corresponding concepts from complexity science.
<br>
<br>The ideas proposed by effectuation has some corresponding complexity principles. Following are some of them.
<br>
<br>
<br>1. Self-Organization/Effectual dynamics
<br>
<br>Effectual dynamics is the dynamics of self-organization. Self-Organization refers to the feature of systems that appear to organize themselves without external direction or control. Self-organization has been used to describe swarms, flocks, traffic, and many other systems where the local interactions lead to a global pattern or behavior (Camazine et al., 2003; Gershenson, 2007). Intuitively, self-organization implies that a system increases its own organization. Self-organization of the effectual entrepreneur is initiated with an examination of the means available to an entrepreneur. The questions “Who am I?”, “What do I know?”, and “Whom do I know?” allow for an examination of the means available to an entrepreneur, which allows him or her to consider what he or she can do (Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005). Through interacting with others and engaging with stakeholders, the entrepreneur discovers new means and establishes new goals that allow for revaluation of means and possible courses of action (Fisher, 2012) 
<br>
<br>
<br>2. The attractor/ Intention
<br>
<br>Self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Ashby(1947b), the father of modern conception of self-organisations showed that, almost any dynamical system can be seen as self-organizing: if it has an attractor, and we decide to call that attractor “organized”, then the system dynamics will tend to it, thus increasing by itself its own organization(Fernandez el al., 2013). So the question is, Who or what is the attractor according to effectuation. Is it the entrepreneur, or intention. Since effectuation has a lot of roots in the work of Herbert Simon, especially "The Sciences of the Artificial"(Simon, 1968) I prefer to take evidence from his work quoting Saraswathy herself, "For Simon, human intention and design were central to the social sciences, and the word ‘man-made’ was synonymous with artificial"(Sarasvathy, 2008). From that foundation it is logical to assume recognition of "intention as the attractor(Juarrero, 2010)". Intention is also a valid concept in entrepreneurship(Bird, 1989;  Shapero and Sokol, 1982; Krueger and Carsrud, 1993). According to Juarrero(2004), "new intention reorganize the earlier state space into a more differentiated and complex set of qualitatively novel options. This means that once an agent formulates a prior intention, every possible behavioral alternative no longer requires consideration; only a partitioned subset does (cf. BRATMAN, 1987)".
<br>
<br>3. Phase space disposition 
<br>
<br>According to Saraswathy, the process elements of effectuation begins with entrepreneurs asking who they are, what they know and whom they know. This corresponds to the idea of knowing the disposition of phase space or state space of a complex adaptive system. In complexity science, the 'phase space'(or state space) is the representation of all possible instantaneous states that can occur in a physical system (Butkovskiy 1990, Sayama 2015).  It can be thought of as the space within, around or adjacent to which a complex adaptive system can self-organize and emerge. While we may not be able to know precisely how a system might change, we do know that it will be most likely within the phase space. A change in emergent phenomena within a phase space may be incremental. A radical change suggests a shift in phase space, a qualitative difference in the system(Byrne &amp; Callaghan, 2014). According to Dave Snowden, in complex adaptive systems, "at a system level, we have no linear material cause but instead we have a dispositional state, a set of possibilities and plausibilities in which a future state cannot be predicted. This is particularly important because, in a complex system, phase space disposition,( and or sense of direction) is what decides on the evolutionary potential of the system, not any specific fixed goal. If a system is complex(no causality), "you can’t set outcome targets a priori, but you can define a vector target (direction and speed of change from the present against intensity of effort). You can’t manage to a desired future state but have to manage the evolutionary potential of the situated present. You can’t predict the future, but you can increase resilience in there the here and now which will allow you to manage that uncertainty"(Snowden, 2017). 
<br>
<br>I argue that an effectual entrepreneur, by asking questions such as; who they are?, what they know? and whom they know?, effectively is trying to make sense of the dispositional propensities, so that they can utilize the evolutionary potential of the present to decide of what to do.
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Adjacent Possible.
<br>
<br>From the understanding of disposition comes the "The bird-in-hand principle" that refers to a principle of means-driven(as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. To effectuation, entrepreneurs focus on what they can do and do it, without worrying much about what they ought to do. This idea is similar to acting in the adjacent possible(Kauffman, 1996), i.e. a kind of zone of proximal development(Vygotsky, ), towards which change and evolution is more likely because of current disposition of the system. The concept of “adjacent possible” was introduced by Stuart Kauffman (1996; 2000) in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems to explain how biological evolution can be seen as exploration and actualization of what is adjacent possible. It can be defined as “the set of possibilities available to individuals, communities, institutions, organisms, productive processes, etc., at a given point in time during their evolution” (Loreto 2015, p. 9). The concept of the “adjacent possible” is useful for understanding how entrepreneurial adjacent possibilities emerge, and how the new adjacent possible will lead to yet newer adjacent possibilities. In the case of effectual entrepreneurs, they will focus on the adjacent possible than worry about things they don't possess. They will focus on what they can do and do it.  
<br>
<br>Any failure inside the zone of adjacent possible will not likely result in system destruction, but likely help development of system resilience. The affordable-loss principle to me is a heuristics based on this idea. It prescribes committing in advance to what one is willing to lose rather than investing in calculations about expected returns to the project. If an effectual entrepreneur commit 6 months and 10000k, that commitment itself will shape the constraints of the adjacent possible.  
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Co-evolution and Co-adaptation
<br>
<br>For a system to self-organize, its elements need to communicate: they need to “understand” what other elements, or mediators, “want” to tell them(Gershenson,2007). Thus, first of all, in a complex system, dynamics of self-organization is initiated and manifested by heterogeneous agents interacting with one another in a non-linear and continuous way. Even if specific agents may only interact with a few others, the impact of these interactions are propagated throughout the system. Accordingly agents co-evolve with one another (Anderson, 1999). Through this interaction agents strives to improve its fitness with the environment but the outcome of these attempts depends on the disposition and behaviors of other agents(Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). Thus, co-evolution is one of the key theme when it comes to viewing the system as a whole(the nested and entangled relationships with multiple complex adaptive systems), which refers to the simultaneous evolution of entities and their environments, whether these entities are organisms or organizations(Baum &amp; Singh, 1994). It encompasses the twin notions of inter-dependency and mutual adaptation, with the idea that species or organizations evolve in relation to their environments, while at the same time these environments evolve in relation to them.  In effectuation this is parallel to initiated interaction and crazy-quilt principle. This principle involves interacting and "negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. Furthermore, who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa". This involves co-evolutionary potential of interacting agents constituted by the principles we have discussed till now, but applied to the other side. They are; The Intention(attractor) of other agents, Phase space disposition of interacting agents, Adjacent possible of interacting agents.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>5, Acknowledging and appropriating Emergent property
<br>
<br>Complex adaptive systems show emergent properties. Emergent properties refers to a characteristic that is found across the system but which individual parts of the system do not themselves hold. E.g. Human heart is made of heart cells. But heart cells on their own don't have the property of pumping blood. You will need the whole heart to be able to pump blood. Thus, the pumping property of the heart is emergent.  A complex system like entrepreneurship has emergent property. That means the emergent or emerging venture idea maybe different from ideas the entrepreneur has initially conceived. Thus initial idea maybe to start HTML5 supported location-based service; The emergent outcome could be Instagram. Initial idea maybe to develop an app to compare two people’s pictures and rate which one was more attractive; The emergent outcome could be Facebook.  The lemonade principle of effectuation is based on adapting, using and improvising according to emergent realities, whether it is perceived as negative or positive. It suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. This means accepting the emergent realities as it comes, adapting, acknowledging and appropriating the contingencies as it unfolds. 
<br> 
<br>The pilot-in-the-plane principle urges relying on and working with human agency as the  prime driver of opportunity rather than limiting entrepreneurial efforts to 
<br>exploiting exogenous factors such as technological trajectories and socioeconomic trends.  This is equivalent to elements of Lichtenstein's(2016) concept of generative emergence that views entrepreneurial emergence as intentional, and agency, even if distributed, as the source of successful organizing. To the framework, intention is the primary attractor around which self-organisation takes place. In-order for effective self-organization to take place, the agent must use agency, not to exert control that is driven by his/her own bounded rationality, or the rules of perceived local optima, but a kind of meta agency. 
<br>
<br>For the framework I propose a working definition meta agency.It is an agency that;
<br>
<br>* Is not only distributed across actors (Garud and Kotha,1994; Tsoukas, 1996; Girard and Stark, 2001), but it is embedded as well(Garud and Karnøe, 2003)
<br>
<br>* Is aware(connected, entangled) of its(his/her) own Intention(attractor), Phase space disposition, Adjacent possible.
<br>
<br>* Is aware(connected, entangled) of the Intention(attractor) of other systems/agents, Phase space disposition of other systems/agents, Adjacent possible of other systems/agents.(Can be called effectual empathy)
<br>
<br>* that continuously explore the global and local phase space simultaneously. The contextual dimensions of ASTRONAUT can be used as initial enabling constraints. 
<br>
<br>* has the ability to use Meta-CAD that include using cognition, action and design in a meta level(see part 2(ll), disposition 1).  
<br>
<br>     
<br>
<br>6. Effectual Self-organisation cycle 
<br>
<br>A complex system is always dispositional and I have discussed quoting Snowden that we can only know the system by how it is disposed. "you can’t set outcome targets a priori, but you can define a vector target (direction and speed of change from the present against intensity of effort). You can’t manage to a desired future state but have to manage the evolutionary potential of the situated present". Since the system is always changing, the bird in hand or disposition is also parallelly evolving. This warrants continues reappraisal of the situated present. The effectual cycle suggest always looping back and cycle-through five core principles in a non-linear manner(bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane). More specifically there are two types converging cycles mentioned; expanding means and converging goals. The expanding-means cycle looks for increases in resources; and the Converging goals cycle adapts the goals. "It accretes constraints on the venture that converge into specific goals that get embodied in an effectual artifact over time”(Sarasvathy et al, 2014; Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005, pp. 543–544). This is also a feedback about emergent realities that will lead to estimation of the new phase space disposition, new adjacent possible, new co-evolutionary potential, new action, etc.&nbsp;</p>

E.g Human body self-organizes with the constraints of genetics and skeleton system. This means constraints are integral part of self-organization.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">In the previous part I have discussed about effectual self-organization as an ideal praxis for entrepreneurship. Self-organization is a ubiquitous phenomena and effectuation is one of the most widely recognized theories in entrepreneurship with huge research output. Like all self-organizing systems, effectual self-organization is also is driven by local interactions. All complex adaptive systems self-organize, but to me the deliberate use of effectual logic make all the difference.&nbsp;<br><br>I have already discussed why effectuation is an ideal decision logic that is appropriate for self-organizing systems. While effectual self-organization is one of the best tools we have available to act in the complex entrepreneurial ecology, It is not free from various constraints. The outcome will be mostly determined by constraints by which, through which and around which self-organisations takes place.&nbsp;<br><br>Following are some of the key concerns when it comes to self-organization in the social world, particularly in entrepreneurship ecology.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>The adjacent possible in a hyper connected and complex social world<br></strong><br>The adjacent possible is not locally or geographically bound in the social world. Paul Selden and Denise Fletcher(2015) brilliantly articulated this aspect by quoting works by people like Herbert Simon and Prigogine. They argue that complex social systems is different from biological and  physical systems(Prigogine and Stengers, 1984), where hierarchies&nbsp;are distinguished by  spatial organization,i.e. ‘relative spatial propinquity’(Simon, 1962: 469). For example, the subsystems that constitute the complex system of the human body, are spatially organized within the body as a physical entity. In contrast, the interaction of subsystems and subsystem components in social systems is unconstrained by spatial proximity because interaction is mediated by ‘symbolic meaning systems’(Simon, 1962: 469–470)".
Thus in social systems the local optima may not be located in the geographical adjacency.<strong> Further,</strong> this aspect is extended and amplified by the technology mediated connectivity revolution happening around us.&nbsp;This make it very interesting to study the<strong> issue of adjacent possible in a hyper connected and dynamic social world.&nbsp;</strong>In a hyper connected world the local-global separation is fast disappearing.&nbsp;Even the local optima is globally distributed, the adjacent possible is not physical adjacent possible.
This means there will always be the possibility of a&nbsp;<strong>perceived adjacent possible</strong> and there will be an <strong>actual adjacent possible. It is possible that the entrepreneurial agent get stuck in the perceived&nbsp;adjacent possible&nbsp;for long periods of time. </strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Self-organization under bounded conditions(<em>exposure,&nbsp;environment,&nbsp;rationality</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br><br>Research has shown that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does to established firms and that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice prematurely across many decisions(Cohen et al, 2018). This satificing(Simon, 1955)  behaviour in the adjacent possible is absolutely ideal, but the real problem is whether the entrepreneur is driven by attractors of the local optima or global optima, and whether the entrepreneur will be stuck in the local optima for many years before realizing the existence of an adjacent global optima. As demonstrated by effectuation, entrepreneurs generally start their venture with a preference to ‘local search’, whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge. This could lead to the identification of local optima rather than global optima(Keinz &amp; Prügl, 2010; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001; Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996).&nbsp;This was also confirmed by an empirical study done by Shane(2000) that has also shown that entrepreneurs tend to identify opportunities that were either already known to them in the past or are closely related to their existing stock of knowledge. This local search behavior is of inevitable importance but the problem is that focusing on existing knowledge and expertise alone can Impede the entrepreneur from exploring distant solutions(Helfat, 1994; Fleming &amp; Sorenson, 2004) or even the real adjacent global optima. <br><br>Further, environmental constraints, including lack of exposure to relevant ideas or models may prevent the travel to global optima. According to innovation historian Anton Howes, "Absent any exposure to inventors, people simply don’t become inventors. Knowing about invention as an activity is a necessary precondition to becoming an inventor yourself. The vast majority of people never innovate, for the very simple reason that it never occurs to them to do so"(Howes, 2021). His historical evidence have exposed the importance of proximity, mentoring, community, and reputation in the development of new innovators(Howes, 2017; Howes, 2017a; Howes, 2016). If a person who never have got any exposure to business models other that local brick and mortar retail( if he is about to start a business), he will never be able to imagine the possibilities of internet, platform model, network effect, etc. He will most likely start a business in his local optima, i.e. retail.&nbsp;<br><br>Following are key points that I want to point from this discussion.<br><br>&nbsp;&gt; There is no local-global separation in the social world. This make it important to have some visibility towards the dynamics of global state space. Effectual self-organization by default doesn't provide any dispositional capabilities for sense-making or exploration towards the global phase space.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&gt; For a design to be sustainable it must acknowledge that the end-users are fallible humans with bounded rationality. It must take into account cognitive limitations, bias, and dysfunctional dispositions. Models must anticipate the potential issues that could arise from bounded rationality and compensate for it with built-in design solutions.&nbsp;Effectual self-organization doesn't provide dispositional capabilities for awareness about bounded rationality or limitation.<br><br>&gt; Effectual self-organization model cannot by default have functional dispositions as discussed in part 2. This require deliberate design.<br></p>

<br>
<br>Designers who operate in complex domains must need to constrain the design-space(state space). For this purpose they often impose a (top-down) primary generator(Darke, 1979) or use bottom-up opportunistic design strategies or combinations of both(Kelso et al, 2016). By doing so designers explore the ‘design territory’ in which the design problem and solution co-evolve(Dorst and Cross 2001). The approach employed by this framework is also based on balancing the contradictions(design and self-organization). I.e., I have already introduced the idea of effectual self-organization in the last part. This part is about constraints based design for enabling better self-organization. 
<br>
<br>Self-organization and design
<br>
<br>Self-organisation depends mostly on the constraints that affect it. This warrants the question, is it possible to design for self-organization?. Is it possible to increase the likelihood of a system moving to an optimal direction than staying in a sub-optimal location, or move to a dysfunctional state.  According to Gershenson(2017), "designing for self-organization can be very useful in complex systems where the observer cannot a priori conceive of all possible configurations, purposes, or problems that the system may be confronted with. Examples of these are organizations (corporations, governments, communities), traffic control, distributed robotics, allocation of ecologic resources, self-assembling nanotubes, and complex software systems(Heylighen and Gershenson, 2003) such as the Internet".  These examples suggests that domains like engineering are also increasingly using this ambidextrous approach where bottom-up and top down approaches are used. In engineering, elements are designed to dynamically and autonomously solve a problem or perform a function at the system level(self-organizing) . In other words, the engineer will not build a system to perform a function explicitly, but elements will be engineered in such a way that their behaviour and interactions will lead to the system function. Thus, for e.g., a car is not a self-organizing system because the parts of a car are designed to drive. Such parts of a car do not change their behavior in time. On the other hand, a swarm of robots(Dorigo et al., 2004) will be conveniently described as self-organizing, since each element of the swarm can change its behavior depending on the current situation(Gershenson, 2017). 
<br>
<br>One of the key concerns about this approach is that self-organization generally imply that order emerge spontaneously as a purely bottom-up process. One the other hand, design implies that order and organization come into being by virtue of a designer in a top-down manner. According to Scott Kelso et al(2016) this dichotomy is the wrong way to view this because, self-organization may require both bottom-up and top-down processes, and design that ignores bottom-up collective effects are at its own peril. Likewise, self-organization that happens in human domains can gain a lot from design, since it can deliberately prevent issues like lock-ins in local optima, global blindness, etc. With that insight in mind this part is about using various constraints to bias the self organization towards relevant contextual and functional dispositions above mentioned(in part 2).   
<br>
<br>
<br>Introduction to Constraints 
<br>
<br>Constraints in general sense may be taken as restrictive. But in a complexity perspective constraints have a different understanding. Here, it is important to understand constraints are enabling too. They create opportunity for action, thoughts and creation. Order in human life is primarily created through constraints. "It is not something which merely limits possibilities, constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced”(Cilliers, 2001). For example, take the case of road traffic. Without conventions that shape how we drive(left or right), as well as our expectations of other drivers, smooth road transport will not be possible. Take the example of HTML, a constrained protocol that allows us to use the web. A cricket game works as a game because of various constraints like cricket ground, various constrained roles like bowler, batsman, fielder, keeper, etc, and various associated rules that govern the game. Without this we wouldn't have cricket as a game. Therefore, constraints not only remove or limit options but also create or enable order and new possibilities. 
<br>
<br>The mentioning of constraints as enabling can also be found in mainstream entrepreneurship research, for e.g. Ted Baker's idea of entrepreneurial Bricolage has emerged from, "A field study of 29 resource-constrained firms", observed that using bricolage" firms survive and even flourish, solving problems and exploiting opportunities despite resource constraints".  Further, constraints has found an important place in the research on creativity, in that the concept of "constraints" are built into the construct of creativity itself(Kaufman and Sternberg, 2010). Research also has consistently found that without constraints, there can be no creativity (Boden, 2004; Dyer, Gregersen and Christensen, 2009; Johnson-Laird, 1988; Stokes, 2006). Both theoretical and empirical contributions investigating the entwinement of creativity and constraints exemplify the dual role of constraints, as constraints can be both limiting and enabling in creative processes (Joyce, 2009; Negus and Pickering, 2004; Onarheim and Wiltschnig, 2010; Stokes, 2008,Onarheim and Biskjaer; 2013). 
<br>
<br>
<br>The Science Of Constraints.
<br>
<br>The concept of constraints has rich background in science. It has been studied for over a hundred years, particularly in the pure sciences like chemistry, physics, biology and evolution. According to Stuart Kauffman, "astonishingly simple rules, or constraints, suffice to ensure that unexpected and profound dynamical order emerges spontaneously"(Kauffman, 1995, p. 1). To Guerin and Kunkle(2004) scientific theories that claim to resolve fundamental issues of organization(self-organization) seek to explain the emergence of organization as an expected consequence of driving constraints forcing systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Listed theories being; Atkins, 1984; Brooks &amp; Wiley, 1986; Kauffman, 2000; Kugler &amp; Turvey, 1987; Prigogine, 1962, 1984; Schneider and Kay, 1994; Swenson, 1989; Tsallis, 1998; Ulanowicz, 1986.  This proves that one of the fundamental question in science is the emergence of order in complex physical, chemical and biological systems as they change over time?  That is: how do they evolve, adapt, develop, mature, alter, modify, adjust and (re)organize, etc.  And as an answer to this questions, the role of constraints has been studied. It has been observed that the surrounding energy patterns in an environment that act as information that constrains complex systems to adapt over different timescales, resulting in different patterns over time. In addition to that, It can be said that all the systems that flow and have the ability to morph their configurations under constraints, will progress in steps of geometric form toward better performance – conglomerates of flows that flow more easily. They survive because they change, i. e., they project themselves into the future by flowing through beneficially altered configurations(Bejan, 2006) .  
<br>
<br>Further, when a Complex adaptive system encounters different conditions in the environment, it will self-organize to generate new structures to ‘represent’ those conditions. Self-organization under such constraints is considered ideal because it can develop a distributed form of internal structure(Cilliers). In this, the structure is neither a passive reflection of the outside, nor a result of active, pre-programmed internal factors, but the result of a complex interaction between the environment, the present state of the system, and the history of the system. In such a system, constraints can shape the emergence of self-organization; of events like movement, cognition, decision making, interactions, social organizations, etc. There must be conditions in the environment that offer enabling constraints that can limit what the system can do--to prevent it from being overwhelmed, but at the same time provide evolutionary potential. 
<br> 
<br>
<br>Application of constraints: 3 models for designing the entrepreneurial self-organization framework
<br>
<br>Complexity based design approaches are gaining a lot of interest now a days. Use of constraints in designing for complex domains is an ideal practice because of the scientific strength of the concept. For the design of my framework, I am adopting insights form 3 of the most influential perspectives that use constraints based approach to theory and design. They are;
<br>
<br>1. Lila Gatlin's context-sensitive constraints and context-free constraints, as articulated by Alicia Juarrero. 
<br>
<br>One of the recent philosophical influence that attempted to set clarity on the idea of constraints and use of it as enablers is Alicia Juarrero's "Dynamics in Action". Juarrero identifies formal uses of the concept of constraints in many places. Two examples she uses are in physical mechanics and information theory. In physical mechanics she quotes Lindsay(1961, 239) who notes that "some of the most important cases of constrained motion are those in which particles are connected by rods and strings" and cannot, therefore, move any which way. Thus in physical mechanics, constraints are said to "compel " and "force" behavior. The term constraints here suggests not as an external force that pushes, but a thing's connection to something else by rods, cords, strings , and the like as well as to the setting in which the object is situated. She suggests that, in opposition to Newtonian science and modern philosophy 's dismissal of relational properties as subjective, Lindsay's "constraints" means something other than Newtonian causality, i.e., as features either of an object 's connections with the environment or of its embeddedness in that environment. Constraints are therefore relational properties that parts acquire in virtue of being unified, not just aggregated into asystematic whole. It thus has shown that constraints not only reduce the number of alternatives, they simultaneously create new possibilities.  
<br>
<br>Secondly, Juarrero introduces information theory, primarily the work of Lila Gatlin to clarify importance of constraints when transmitting or receiving a message, which requires a clear demarcation between message and background noise. Constraining the number of ways in which the various parts of a system can be arranged reduces randomness by altering the equiprobable distribution of signals, thereby enabling potential information to become actual information. Constraints thus turn the amorphous potential into the definite actual. Constraints work, then, by modifying either a system's phase space or the probability distribution of events and movements within that space. Constraints thus create coherence. 
<br>
<br>Further, according to Juarrero, Lila Gatlin (1972) distinguishes between two types of constraints: context-free constraints, which take a system's components far from equiprobability , and context-sensitive constraints, which synchronize and correlate previously independent parts into a systemic whole. When organized into a complex, integral whole, parts become correlated as a function of context-dependent constraints imposed on them by the newly organized system in which they are now embedded. A context free-constraint can be seen as a bias, assumption, preference, shared vision, intentions, etc. A context-sensitive constraint is something that is conditional on a state in the context. In entrepreneurship it can be end user preference, technology penetrations, government  policy, infrastructure, etc.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>2. Constraints-led approach(CLA) in sports coaching 
<br>
<br>The CLA is based on the fundamental concept of the mutuality of the performer and environment (Gibson, 1979/1986) in which learner will self-organize to generate effective movement solutions through the interaction of the three core categories of constraints– task, environment and individual(Renshaw et al., 2010). The practitioners are therefore encouraged to design learning activities that allow individuals or groups of individuals to self-organize and co-adapt to changing constraints. The CLA has developed and evolved over the years by incorporating key ideas from multiple theoretical perspectives like ecological dynamics theory, ecological psychology, dynamical systems theory, evolutionary biology, and complexity science. It considers athletes and sports teams as complex adaptive systems--a network of highly integrated, interacting sub-components(Renshaw et al., 2010). 
<br>
<br>CLA acknowledges that Constraints both limit and enable the number of behavioral trajectories that the system can adopt. Complex systems are able to exploit the constraints that surround them in order to allow functional patterns of behavior to emerge in specific contexts. Secondly, CLA views constraints as either physical or informational. Physical constraints can be structural or functional in the human movement system. Functional physical constraints include processes such as reactions and perceptual abilities, which support movement performance.  Informational constraints, on the other hand, are the various forms of energy flowing through the system. In complex adaptive systems, the multitude of parts continually forms coordinated patterns (synergies), which are shaped by surrounding such informational constraints. Thus states of order emerge under constraints. This idea has been imported into human movement science from physics and biology, where scientists have been engaged in studying the emergence of movement behaviors under constraints(e.g., Kelso, 1995; Kugler, 1986; Kugler &amp; Turvey, 1987; ). 
<br>
<br>
<br>The constraints-led approach's fundamental design concept has originated in the work of Newell (1986) who identified the interaction of three core categories of constraints – task, environment, and Organismic(individual), through which a learner will self-organize in his attempt to generate effective movement solutions(Renshaw et al., 2010). The coaching model thus involves manipulating, changing, designing these three core categories of constraints(task, environment, and individual) to promote self-organized capabilities and skills. The specific focus of practitioners is therefore on designing learning activities that allow individuals or groups of individuals to self-organize and co-adapt to changing constraints. 
<br>
<br>The three core categories of Newell's constraints can be elaborated as follows;
<br>
<br>Organismic Constraints: Organismic constraints refer to a person’s characteristics, such as genes, height, weight, muscle–fat ratio, connective strength of synapses in the brain, cognitions, motivations, emotions and all other features that can be added to this category.  A crucial difference between other biological organisms and humans are also important to note. Humans can use internal energy sources to intentionally constrain their actions to achieve goals or desired outcomes. That is, human behavior is not deterministic but can be intentionally driven(Kugler et al., 1990). 
<br>
<br>Environmental Constraints: Environmental constraints are global, physical variables in nature, such as ambient light, temperature, or altitude. On Earth, gravity is a key environmental constraint on movement coordination for all tasks Additionally, some environmental constraints are social rather 
<br>than physical, including family support, peer groups, societal expectations, values, and cultural norms (Haywood &amp; Getchell, 2005). 
<br>
<br>Task Constraints: Task constraints are usually more specific to performance contexts than environmental constraints are and include task goals, specific rules associated with an activity, activity-related implements or tools, surfaces, ground areas, and pitches and boundary markings such as nets, line markings, and posts. Even with apparently stable activities, such as playing a musical instrument or swinging a golf club, motor behavior can fluctuate because the task constraints may vary from performance to performance. 
<br>
<br>Interacting Constraints: When athletes engage in goal-directed action, the interaction of organismic, environmental, and task constraints on the neuromuscular system results in the emergence of different states of coordination that become optimized with practice and experience. Because of the interactive nature of these constraints, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish among them. This can be called interacting constraints. 
<br>
<br>
<br>3. Cynefin framework.
<br> 
<br>When it comes to the application of constraints, Dave Snowden's Cynefin is one of the most comprehensive. Its foundation is built on Lila Gatlin's theory of Information in Living System and  Juarrero's philosophical perspective in her book Dynamics in Action. Cynefin is built as a sense-making meta-framework that uses constraints as the key concept in defining and distinguishing its core typology, ie. It views the constraints of a system as informing and shaping the behavior of that system by modifying its phase space, i.e. its range of possible actions and movements within that space. The construct and evolution of Cynefin is centered on the understanding that complexity in human society is different from other types of complexity. The term Anthro-complexity is used to represent such complexity, which is a way of framing the ordinary, everyday landscape of human interaction. 
<br>
<br>In Cynefin, constraints play a key role in helping us understand the differences between its key domains in its typology. These typologies are; the clear, complicated, complex, and chaotic. The Clear domain is associated with Rigid constraints, Complicated domain is associated with Governing constraints, Complex domain is associated with Enabling constraints, Chaotic domain is associated with the absence of constraints. 
<br>
<br>Rigid Constraints are rigid without any possibility or need for breaking it  Deadlines are an example of constraints that are usually intended to be rigid. Governing Constraints give a sense of stability but are sensitive to change. Examples are Laws, rules, and codes, etc.  Enabling constraints are meant to enable us to do something by constraints certain possibilities. For eg, Heuristics and principles provide guidance while allowing for distributed decision-making. And finally, absence of constraints is viewed as chaotic Unlike in ordered systems (where the system constrains the agents), or chaotic systems (where there are no constraints), in a complex system the agents and the system constrain one another, especially over time. This means that we cannot  forecast or predict what will happen(Snowden and Boon, ).
<br>
<br>Cynefin also have other types of constraints like; Internal/External Constraints, Connecting/Containing Constraints, Flexible/Permeable Constraints, Dark Constraints, Mutating Constraints, Loose Constraints, Elastic Constraints(Snowden, 2016; Cynefin wiki, 2021). 
<br> 
<br>
<br>In conclusion following are the core theoretical and practical insights specifically used for the ESOF design.
<br>
<br>Firstly, the core design is based on the idea of Context-sensitive constraints and context-free constraints. This is taken as proposed by Lila Gatlin's information theory, and as articulated by Alicia Juarrero's philosophical framing. Context sensitive constraints are designed based on some of the persisting dimensions of the entrepreneurial state space. Context free constraints are introduced as desirable functional dispositions that are globally applicable to both the user and the framework itself. This should not be viewed as a permanent structure, but as a malleable scaffold.
<br>
<br>Secondly, from the constraints-led approach to sports coaching, Newell's(1986) three categories of constraints are preferred to think about various context-sensitive constraints that are in operation in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Apart from the three core categories of constraints–task, environment, and Organismic(individual), in entrepreneurship it is possible to think about the constraints of or by the socio-material artifact(idea, image, prototype, mvp, startup, etc). Thus apart from the interactive constraints that is an emergent combination of all of the constraints, 4 core categories of constraints can be identified in entrepreneurship; Task, Environment, Organismic(individual), and Socio-material artifact((idea, prototype, MVP, organization, etc). Further, the constrain based coaching model can be used by ecosystem actors to mentor entrepreneurs, in which, when it comes to complex issues, mentors don't give or prescribe solutions,  but provide or design constraints that enable the emergence towards an better state depending on the current disposition.  
<br>
<br>Thirdly, Cynefin framework can be viewed as a globally applicable context-free constraint to design constraints itself according to various dynamic contextual demands. Entrepreneurs may encounter all kinds of situation including contexts like; clear, complicated, complex, and chaotic. All require different actions. Cynefin may help.&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br>Self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Once there, the further dynamics and evolution of the system are likely constrained to remain near the attractor(Ashby, W. R., 1947). Other-words, In complex emergent system, an attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through. They are islands of stability in a sea of chaos. Complex systems are inherently chaotic and unstable, but, they usually settle down into one of a number of possible steady states. These steady states are called "attractor basins". For any system we can create what is called a state space that represents all the possible states that that system might take.  Some examples of attractor states are; Traffic patterns in a city in working days, Distribution of ethnic groups across many multicultural cities, Distribution of political opinions across the different regions of some nation, etc.  
<br>
<br>Thus, one of the most important challenge of this framework is to identify and design constraints that enable entrepreneurial self-organization towards a global optima, instead of being stuck in local optima(attractor). It is also an important agenda to make it easier for agents to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if s/he had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree). 
<br>  
<br>   
<br>Designing enabling-constraints for entrepreneurial self-organization. 
<br>
<br>Unlike sports(or established organizations), entrepreneurship has less pre-given constraints like environment(football ground), objective goal(score a goal), rules(rules of engagement), player( limited numbers), etc. This means both uncertainty and potentiality are high. Thus the idea is not to provide perfect design for everybody, but design for self-organization and evolvability in design itself. The bigger agenda is also to encapsulate an ecology of ideas in an accessible, learnable, usable and teachable way. Entrepreneurship operates in the evolutionary edge of social emergence. This means that the core aspect of entrepreneurship is about dealing with extreme uncertainty. But even in this uncertainty we can identify some stable elements which form part of the entrepreneurship. 
<br>
<br>I have identified following 8 exploratory dimensions in entrepreneurial state space as enabling constraints. It is encouraged to continuously explore these 8 constrain dimensions for insights and affordances. 
<br>
<br>1. Agent: Human Being, end user or the kind 
<br>2. Socio-materiality: The society and its dynamics including technology and material aspects.
<br>3. Context: Every moment of the an agent's life represents a different context, which may include dimensions like time, situation, role, and relationships, etc.
<br>4. Human Needs: Human needs are commonly used to refer to the drivers of peoples' actions, the motives behind human behavior.
<br>5. Organization and Delivery system: The fundamental function of an entrepreneurial organization is to cater to human needs. This is a mature form of emergence developed from the entrepreneur and his startup.
<br>6. Network and ecosystem dependencies: This represents the structure, connections and embeddedness of the organization in a ecosystem.
<br>7. Atmosphere: This include the features of the business atmosphere or environment. E.g  5 forces, PESTLE, etc 
<br>8. Unconventional forces: This includes watching out for things and forces that are unconventional, etc Corona Virus, Exponential Technologies and its combinations, etc. 
<br>
<br>It must also be noted that boundary conditions in complex systems are like membranes and not like walls(Juarrero ). Thus these 8 dimensions are part of the same state space, hence, encouraged not to see it as separate from the whole. They are interconnected and one in its dynamics. By accepting the inseparable-inter-connectedness it is easy for us to maintain the complexity perspective in mind. 
<br>
<br>Further, the list of eight is not comprehensive, but just the result of my satisficing effort to design a scaffold that enable the entrepreneur to capture the nature of global state space. Entrepreneurial agents are encouraged to add, remove or design, their own constraints as necessary.</p>

Meta dispositions are a kind of context free constraints that are applicable to the whole of the framework. While the first 8 exploratory dimensions constitute contextual constraints(Agent, Socio-materiality, Context, Needs, Organization, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional force). This part is about dispositional features of the framework itself. The term disposition according to dictionary means following; "inherent qualities of mind and character", "an inclination or tendency", "the way in which something is placed or arranged, especially in relation to other things", etc. This includes features like  Meta-CAD(cognition, action, design), diversity, adaptability, evolvability, agency, permanent construction, etc.
<br>  
<br>Now it looks like:
<br>
<br>1. Agent: End user, human Being or the kind 
<br>2. Socio-materiality: The society and its dynamics. It also includes technology and material aspects. 
<br>3. Temporal and Contextual Factors: The word temporal related to time(past present and future) represents the contextual dimension not just related to current context but past and future. Context is a frame that surrounds the event and provides resources for its appropriate interpretation. Every moment of the an Agent's life represents a different context, which may include dimensions like Situation, role, and relationships, etc.

It is also the aim of the framework to create a cognitive shift, to make it easier for users to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if they has to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree).&nbsp;</p>

<br>
<br>Most of the existing entrepreneurship models previously discussed are like a standalone algorithms designed for a particular objective purpose and that alone. This comes with a lot of flaws which I have already discussed in part 1. This is why we need inbuilt enabler for meta-CAD. Initially I introduced this disposition as meta-cognition alone, but later made the judgement that cognition alone is passive. This thought has prompted me to include actionability(action &amp; design) in CAD.    
<br>
<br>Meta-cognition is defined as "cognition about cognition". It refers to the awareness of one’s own knowledge—what one does and doesn’t know—and one’s ability to understand, control, and manipulate one’s cognitive processes (Meichenbaum, 1985). 
<br>It also involves: 
<br>&gt; The knowledge and processes involved in the appraisal, monitoring or control of cognition. 
<br>&gt; Knowing when and where to use particular strategies for learning and problem solving as well as how and why to use specific strategies. 
<br>&gt; Using prior knowledge to plan a strategy for approaching a learning task, take necessary steps to problem solve, reflect on and evaluate results, and modify one’s approach as needed. 
<br>
<br>In this model Meta-Cognition involves enablers for identifying and fixing Biases, Fixation, framing effects, etc. It also enables exploration towards interdisciplinary intelligence which is outside the scope of this framework. It also aids in deciding when to use focused convergent thinking(exploitative), Diffused divergent thinking(Exploratory), Disruptive re-framing, etc.  
<br>
<br>Meta-Action seeks to keep the meta level sense-making while taking action. In complex domains it maybe necessary to conduct parallel exploratory probes or experiments before deciding to do something significant. In chaotic domains it may require action first. 
<br> 
<br>Meta-design here means progressively creating better designability for the designers, users, etc. In practice, the framework is a meta-design framework that enables entrepreneurs better self-organization. While meta action seeks to act spontaneously Meta-design may involve slow and strategic design solutions for problems.&nbsp;</p>

Thus, In this section, I am introducing the dispositional element of diversity to enable the cultivation of diversity. Evidence on the importance of diversity is overwhelming and can be found in many different disciplines. It is viewed as advantageous because it can help a system to consistently reach and sustain desirable settings for a single system property by providing multiple distinct paths to a particular state.(Whitacre and Bender,2010) 
<br>
<br>When considering biological evolution, genetic diversity helps maintain the health of a population by including alleles that may be valuable in resisting diseases, pests, and other stresses. When and If the environment changes, a population that has a higher variability of alleles will be better able to evolve to adapt to the new environment. Thus genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. Further, biological diversity is essential in the self-organizing ability of complex adaptive systems (Levin, 1999) both in terms of absorbing disturbance and in regenerating and re-organizing the system following disturbance (Folke et al., 2004),(Folke,2006). In social systems, the success of the human species also have a lot to do with diversity. Many animals exhibit social learning and behavioral traditions, but, human culture appears unique in that it is cumulative, i.e. human cultural traits increase in diversity and complexity over time(Legare, 2017). 
<br>
<br>
<br>Importance of diversity was also demonstrated in the studies of various domains and studies. Some examples are; Micro diversity( Allen et al 2006), Functional redundancy (Naeem 1998, (Carpenter et al., 2001, Petchey et al. 2007), Response diversity (Elmqvist et al., 2003) , Diversity in Social-ecological systems(Ellis 2000;Low et al. 2003;Ostrom 2005;Stirling 2007;Chapin et al. 2009;Naeem et al. 2009), Portfolio theory in economics and biodiversity management (Schindler el al ,2010), Problem solving in decision making(Hong and Page, 2014; Page, 2008), Business Performance(Kochan el al, 2003), Cultural diversity(Ely and Thomas, 2001), Cognitive and experiential diversity(Thomas and Ely,1996; Levinson,2003), Ensemble models (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; Sagi and Rokach, 2018; Anderson,1996). 
<br>
<br>
<br>As i have previously discussed it is important to adopt an context specific ecological world view. Ecological world view for entrepreneurship involves a continues effort to capture the true ecological realty in its dynamics. This is different from the false binary model that often pits world view based on a single model, tool, or method which assumes superiority over all other. E.g. Plan Vs Lean startup. This is also different from the ensemble view that propose using Multiple-Models for complimenting each other as an improvement from single model approach.  Another candidate is the Cognitive-Diversity view that suggests use of not only formal models but all kinds of cognitive diversity. This cognitive view is limited and cannot be inclusive of many other types of diversities. The holistic diversity view that I have discussed suggests using not only Cognitive-Diversity but also other kinds of diversities, i.e. diversity in people(not just cognitive, but functional), networks, information sources, relational-expertise, institutions, culture, location, specialization, artifacts, tools, etc. The holistic diversity is better than all three of the previous views(single model, ensemble, cognitive diversity), but it is not truly ecological, since it is not taking account of many key dynamic aspects.  
<br>
<br>This framework adopts an ecological world view that includes diversity approach that is inclusive of all the above views, but also, of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, non linear interaction, etc. This framework provides enabling constraints that are context specific to entrepreneurship, and the entrepreneur. It enables diversity exploration towards context specific entrepreneurial dimensions, i.e. Agent, Socio-materiality, Temporal and Contextual Factors, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional forces. These constraints limit our infinity of options, channel our energy and create new affordances for action.  The framework also provides the entrepreneur with the freedom to add, remove or design h(is/er) own constraints for the purpose. Entrepreneurs operate mostly in the evolutionary edge of social emergence, i.e. the unknown world. They often operate in domains were previously known solutions/tools/apps are absent. This make it difficult to identify a stable set ideas which can be applied in all situations. This is why this framework enables entrepreneurs to introduce new constraints and find tools/repertoire on the go, via abduction and experience. This idea will be expanded in following 2 parts; Enabling Evolvability and Work in progress.

<br>Key Ideas to note
<br>
<br>&gt; Dynamics and Evolution: The diversity or elements of variation in an entrepreneurial ecosystem is constantly in interaction, dynamics, and evolution. Every parts are connected to every other parts and they exchange energy and information. This make it important to be in a continues  exploration mode. Thus, diversity must be approached with the view that, real world has complexity, it is dynamic, It is always evolving, it is connected, elements interact with each other. Practically this means that ideas will evolve, tools will become useless, people will die or move-on, things and forces will mutate together to form unknowns and incomprehensible things. 
<br>
<br>&gt; This must also accommodate exploration of more types of diversity which is missing from above list. There can also be opposing and contradictory diversity too.&nbsp;</p>

Adaptive systems involves designing the elements of a system to find by themselves the solution of the problem. Like this, when the problem changes, the elements are able to dynamically find a new solution. We can say that such a system self-organizes. (Gershenson, 2017). <br><br>A complex system is adaptive when heterogeneous components react differently to outside influences, thus continually modifying the system and allowing it to adapt to altered conditions(Messier el al. 2016). In biology, adaptation primarily involves the dynamic evolutionary process that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. Adaptation is important because it makes a system better and able to sustain itself. This is because nature and evolution do not favor stability and equilibrium: instead, natural processes select for resilience and adaptability(Juarrero, 2015). 
<br>
<br>In-order to adapt to a dynamic environment, a complex system needs a sufficiently large variety(diversity) of possible states to cope with likely perturbations. Further given this variety(diversity), the most adequate configurations are selected according to their fitness, either by the environment, or by subsystems that have already adapted to the environment at an earlier stage.(Heylighen 2001). The same opinion on the relationship between diversity(variation) and adaptation is shared by Constraints-led approach(IAN, 201888), according to which, "Skill adaptation implies that performance goals can still be achieved, as athletes learn to vary their actions according to the information that emerges in unpredictable performance contexts. Adaptation provides a functional relationship between stability (i.e. persistent behaviours) and flexibility (i.e. variable behaviours) during performance. Highly skilled performance is characterized by stable and reproducible movement patterns, which are consistent over time, resistant to perturbations."
<br><br><strong>The central questions&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>The central questions of adaptive dimension are, how to be adaptive?, how to be co-adaptive? and 'how to adapt the knowledge, skill, resources, etc. to best suit the ever changing, ever dynamic entrepreneurial contexts?.&nbsp;<strong>The practical agenda is not about prescribing ways of improving adaptiveness, but to enable the entrepreneurs to find what it means to be adaptive in h(is/er) own context. It is also expected that this will make the entrepreneur and other users ecologically grounded.&nbsp;<br></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>I am calling this part as adaptive dimension because everything we learned and understood previously need to be adapted to entrepreneurial contextual reality in pursuit of entrepreneurial self-organization. This can be represented by interactive, interrelated and contextually unique emergence of the 4 dimensions--Agent, Task, Artifact, Environment.
<br><strong><br>{What causes one kind of complexity to appear and not 
<br>another? In physical and chemical systems it is all based 
<br>on energy differentials (or “gradients”). For firms, the 
<br>“gradient” driving events in firms can be usefully 
<br>conceptualized as adaptive tension (McKelvey 1999c) }&nbsp;<br></strong><br><br><strong>Caution: Contextualizing Cognition for adaptive dimension with 4E</strong><br>
<br>The foundation of traditional cognitive science used to be the representational(&amp; computational) model of cognition. According to this model, cognition is a kind of information processing that consists in the syntactically driven manipulation of representational mental structures. In particular, cognitive processes were said to be computations over mental representations that are symbolic in nature. (Newen el al.&nbsp;2018 ). To me this perspective is incomplete and incapable of giving practical insights without being embedded in the context.<br>
<br>Here I am making an effort to separate this simplistic understanding of cognition with 4E cognition(embodied, embedded, enacted and extended). 4E is a grounded and necessary view of cognition which is more suited for the adaptive and emergent dimensions of entrepreneurship. This distinction is not made to reduce the significance of any perspectives or to compartmentalize the obviously porous and enmeshed relation, but to enable facilitation of actionable knowledge and making knowledge actionable/usable for the entrepreneurial agent. This is made specially in acknowledgement of the contextually divorced and useless cliche advise which is extremely prevalent in the global entrepreneurship thinking space.
<br>
<br>The central argument of 4E is that cognition does not occur exclusively inside the head, but is embodied, embedded, enacted, or extended by way of extra-cranial processes and structures (Rowlands 2010a). <strong>Entrepreneurial cognition thus is embodied</strong> in that cognitive properties and performances crucially depend on facts about his embodiment (Haugeland, 1998; Clark, 1997; Gallagher, 2000). Embodied cognition is when cognition is deeply dependent upon features of the physical body of an agent, that is, when aspects of the entrepreneurial agent's body beyond the brain play a significant role in cognitive processing. Structural limitations, emotions, feelings, movement, perception, etc. are significant aspects of this embodiment. <br><br><strong>Entrepreneurial Cognition is embedded</strong> in that cognitive properties and performances can crucially depend on facts about our relationship to the surrounding environment (Haugeland, 1998; Clark, 1997; Hurley, 1998,). Embedded cognition stresses the idea of situated nature of cognition. It posits that cognition is inseparable and situated in social, cultural and physical contexts.<br><br><strong>Entrepreneurial cognition is enactive,</strong> which means dependent on activities in pursuit of creation of artifact(product, venture, etc). Enactive dimension argues that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment. For this perspective cognition and environment are inseparable, and learning is drawn from the interaction between learner and environment. Finally, <strong>Entrepreneurial cognition can be extended</strong> by using material vehicles beyond the boundaries of the cognizing organism. Entrepreneurs use his networks(other people) and artifacts(tools, money, etc) to effect the extension of his cognition.
<br><br><br><strong>Adaptive process is a continues journey. The evolutionary journey for the entrepreneurial system warrant continues adaptation through out the various evolutionary stages.</strong><br><br></p>

<br>
<br> Evolution is a fundamental feature of nature, biology and human social life. In comparison to biological evolution human social system is capable of adapting to change at a faster rate. It is particularly significant in the case of entrepreneurship in that entrepreneurs often act as catalysts of social evolution and also are affected by smallest of change in the environment. One of the major source of weakness in existing entrepreneurship models is the lack of evolvability. Once proposed and written down the model never changes. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in entrepreneurship domain are self aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it give a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity. 
<br> 
<br>This framework accepts its own own possible weaknesses and contingencies. Everything about this model can be changed and designed to suit the idiosyncrasy of user and the complexity of the context. Evolvability in this framework means you can learn, unlearn, add, subtract, design, create, combine, remix, recombine and customize solutions to suit the ever changing dynamics of idiosyncratic and contextual needs. Other words,"evolving to greater evolvability"(Juarrero, 2015) is the goal here.  
<br>
<br>
<br>Here also, the practical agenda is not about prescribing ways of improving evolvability, but to enable the entrepreneurs to find what it means to be evolvable in h(is/er) own context and think-act-design solutions. The following 3 thinking tools might be helpful(not a prescription) in identifying anti evolutionary structural issues and design solutions. 
<br>
<br>1. Levels: Micro, Mezzo, Macro, Meta.
<br>2. Direction: Co-Evolution of Agent, Artifact and Environment.
<br>3. Pro evolvability features to cultivate.
<br>
<br>
<br>1. Levels: Micro, Mezzo, Macro, Meta
<br>
<br>Enabling evolvability could mean being attuned to various levels of evolvability; Micro, Mezzo, Macro(Brush et al, 2009; Vlados and Chatzinikolaou, 2020; ) and Meta. The nature of these levels are context dependent and will change according to unit of observation(an atom can be micro in one analysis, and macro in another). In entrepreneurship, Micro could mean intention, cognition, local interaction, etc. Mezzo could mean intermediate level interaction co-evolution and adaptation with institutions like local government, VC's, accelerators, businesses, etc. Marco could mean interaction, co-evolution and adaptation with the macro structures, policy, international politics, markets, crisis, etc. Meta level means thinking, acting, and designing about and for better evolvability.
<br>
<br>
<br>2. Direction: Co-Evolution of Agent, Artifact and Environment 
<br>
<br>Entrepreneurial complex adaptive system is not stable. It is continuously evolving. The artifact(complex socio-material artifact that has self-organization tendencies) and the system as a whole(Agent, Artifact, Environment ) evolves continuously in a non linear manner. 
<br>
<br>A richer understanding of evolvabiliy dimension must have to consider the interactive, interrelated and contextually unique emergence of Agent, Artifact and Environment. Selden &amp; Fletcher(2015) depicted this aspect in their non linear model of artifacts as an emergent hierarchical system with 6 levels. The level 1 includes an entrepreneurial sense-making subsystem in the form of a business idea (artifact), which is functional to interaction in entrepreneur–stakeholder subsystems. Level 2 includes the emergence of an operational business model (artifact). At Level 3, the operational business model created at Level 2 is functional to the emergence of firm capabilities (artifacts) and marketable commodities (artifacts) in the entrepreneurial firm subsystem. At level 4 the marketing of a commodity is functional to the emergence for either replicating existing business, product concepts, etc, Or innovative and break away from existing knowledge. At level 5 this market system becomes functional to the formation of firm clusters and regional business relationships. At Level 6 the previous levels become functional to the wider societal emergence of entrepreneurial culture, discourse and practices. This co-emergence of Agent, Artifact and Environment necessitates emergence of strategy and action which suites such emergence. 
<br>
<br>3. Pro-evolvability features to cultivate; These are some of the(find and add more) features that are foundational to evolvability:
<br>
<br>1. Diversity(or variation): As discussed as disposition 2
<br>2. Adaptation and co-adaptation: As discussed as disposition 3
<br>3. Resilience design(Ruhl, 2011), Curtin, 2014: Resilient design is a kind of design that keeps in mind probably future crisis and contingencies. The system will live a day to evolve
<br>4. Destabilizing: Perturbations and destabilization of a system will help that system to cultivate flexibility and paradigm shifts. The disturbance must not be so big to destroy the system itself.
<br>5. Avoid rigid constraints and prescriptions: Rigidity will prevent evolvability, and it is not ecologically grounded. A good example is the list of prescriptive models in entrepreneurship. 
<br>
<br>6. Framework as a scaffold: Scaffolding is a temporary structure used to support development of a structure. It is not meant to be permanent 
<br>Existing prescriptive models and frameworks proposes permanent structures that end up being inflexible. This framework is not designed as a permanent structure but as impermanent scaffold that enable emergence. 
<br>
<br>7. Learning/Learnability: Evolution and evolvability manifests itself in the individual and social domain mostly by learning(cognitive, social, ecological or cumulative cultural). This is why learnability is important. Learnability could mean; learning to learn better and develop the ability to progressively cultivate more and more capabilities to become better, more complex learners. 
<br>
<br>8. Autopoiesis: Autopoiesis refers to a system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself by creating its own parts and eventually further components. An entrepreneur operating in a dynamic environment must have autopoitic ability. To the framework, this means, possibility of creating more parts as the user(entrepreneur). With autopoiesis the the user of the framework can add more parts to the framework structure to deal with his/her own idiosyncratic/contextual issues.</p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Agency is described as an individual’s ability in any given point in time to act independently in order to change the internal or external environment (Bandura, 2001; Campbell, 2009; Hitlin &amp; Elder, 2007).  In a complex and uncertain world we make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. This results in the tendency of the human brain to solve problems in the most simple and straight-forward way rather than utilizing more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This human nature is often exploited by certainty merchants who comes up with confident advise and one-size-fits-all models. As a result people with disciplinary and domain commitments become more committed to disciplinary/domain boundaries and methods aligning perfectly with legacy incentive structures over time. This strong preexisting one-size-fits-all models and other commitments results in the agents evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential is being compromised. 
<br>
<br>The impact of such environment factors on human agency is being discussed extensively in the sociological debate on structure vs agency(Hays, 1994; Mole and Mole, 2008; McAnulla, 2000: 271), ). It is an issue of control exercised by environment against autonomy in determining whether an individual acts as a free agent, or in a manner dictated by socio-material structure.  A clear understanding of such environmental control must also involve the debate on the effect of human artifacts. According to Bruno Latour(Latour 1996), once designed and introduced into the interactional scene by humans---texts, artifacts and objects of any kind make sense and have an agency on their own. The entrepreneurial implication is that artifacts and existing models like Lean startup, business plan, etc., if used as a prescriptive model will have a take-over-effect on the entrepreneurs agency. 
<br>
<br>They make a significant difference in the way we see and act in the world. We can design, create or use them, but in a way they also design, create or use us. We are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments. 
<br> 
<br>
<br>This framework doesn't have any one size fits all solution for the agency problem. Instead it has following pointers: 
<br>
<br>&gt; To the disposition, an entrepreneur must be capable of behaving adaptively, freely and effectively in a given situation, exercising his agency to the fullest. 
<br>
<br>&gt; To the disposition, agency doesn't mean ability to agenda-setting or controlling things, but as a catalyst for self-organization. This is to use to the best the evolutionary potential of the present. This means considering other agencies, co-adaptive potential, co-evolutionary potential, path-dependence, etc. 
<br> 
<br>&gt; The disposition attempt to make the entrepreneur aware of agency and its importance in complex domains were ground realities change rapidly. 
<br>
<br>&gt; It enables and reminds the agent of its agency. It give the entrepreneur complete agency to deal with the agency problem and agency exercise. So it is up to the entrepreneur alone to find solutions to his problems.</p>

<br>For self-organisation, the framework uses effectuation, making it effectual self-organization. In part three, I have attempted to identify various parallel concepts between effectuation and complexity science. They are, self-organization as effectual dynamics, intention as an attractor around which self-organization takes place, phase space disposition, adjacent possible, co-evolution and co- adaptation, meta agency.
<br>
<br>2. Design for Exploration(context sensitive constraints). 
<br>
<br>Self-organization alone may not result in great outcomes. Like the bible parable of the "sower of seed", only the seeds that fell on the good soil will self-organize to produce great corn. Research has found that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does to established firms and that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice(Simon, 1955) prematurely across many decisions(Cohen et al 2018). Another dimension of this issue is that entrepreneurs generally start their venture with a preference to ‘local search’, whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge. This leads to the identification of local optima rather than global optima(Keinz &amp; Prügl, 2010; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001; Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996). I argue that effectual self-organization alone may reinforce and augment bounded rationality and local search behaviour. 
<br>
<br>This make it important to have a kind of Self-organization that relies on balance between exploitation and exploration(Bonabeau et al. 1999; Foreby. et.al 2016). There are various existing models that are based on this idea of designing for such a balance, e.g. Constraints=led approach in sports, Cynefin, Guided self-organization(Prokopenko, 2009), etc. This framework establishes 9 entrepreneurial exploratory dimensions as enabling constraints represented by the abbreviation ASTRONAUT; A: Agent(end user), S: Socio-materiality, T: Temporal and Contextual Factors, R: Real Needs/Wants/Choices, O:Organization and Delivery system, N: Network and ecosystem dependencies, A:Atmosphere, U: Unconventional forces, T: Tatva. The framework urges to continuously explore the space for action possibilities and potential action possibilities(adding diversity). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>3. Various functional meta-dispositions(context free constraints)
<br>
<br>Meta-dispositions are functional dispositional propensities that are applicable to both the framework and the user. These are context free constraints that are applicable to the whole of the framework. While the first 8 exploratory dimensions constitute contextual constraints(Agent, Socio-materiality, Context, Needs, Organization, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional force), this part is about dispositional features of the user and framework itself. The term disposition according to dictionary means following; "inherent qualities of mind and character", "an inclination or tendency", "the way in which something is placed or arranged, especially in relation to other things", etc. This includes features like Meta-CAD(cognition, action, design), diversity, adaptability, evolvability, agency, permanent construction, etc.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Entrepreneurship is a complex decision domain. It is essential that solutions designed for complex domains like entrepreneurship must consider factors like non-linearity, inter-relatedness, emergent property, etc. In contrast to most of the existing models like lean-startup, business plan, etc., this framework is a contextually adaptive entrepreneurial framework for a complex and emergent world. It balances self-organization, a kind of exploit in the local adjacent possible, and exploration towards the global optima. It then uses the meta-dispositions as context free constraints that drive proclivities of the entrepreneur and the framework itself. 
<br>
<br>In contrast to the existing entrepreneurial thinking space, following are some of the key advantages of the framework.
<br>
<br>Contrary to other models and methods, this framework stress the need to harmonize the growing collective human intelligence. This also includes both practitioner and academia developed ideas, and bring it all accessible and affordable for the entrepreneurial actor at the time of his/her decision making and action. This framework promotes other people's models, ideas and insights. To use an analogy, most of existing entrepreneurship advise, and models(prescriptive and descriptive) on entrepreneurship are like apps. This framework is like an app platform like Android or IOS(without the modularity), which enables and even forces constant updation. This means you never have to settle with one or two preinstalled apps(E.g. Lean-startup or Business plan). The framework enables adding of more ideas, heuristics, models like---bricolage, design thinking, user innovation, etc, or build your own. Once a model or idea is brought inside the framework, its propensities like binarization, exclusionism, polarization, parasitism, etc will no longer work. It will be one among many types of variation the agent can use. 
<br>
<br>Contrary to other models and methods, this framework promotes interdisciplinary exploration. Even though real world problems and its solutions are interdisciplinary in nature, most existing entrepreneurial prescriptive models are the result of disciplinary reductionism. It often comes as rigid processes that lacks flexibility. Using these models without understanding laws of entrepreneurial complexity could seriously impair the ability to integrate the wholeness of human individual, social, material realities. This framework has enabling constraints for exploration without boundaries. It is also inclusive of contradictions and diversities. 
<br>
<br>Contrary to other models and methods, this framework makes it easier for you to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if you had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree). Because the framework is built over insights from complexity science, it stresses the need to start the thinking from holistic perspective. Every context is like a black hole, and It demands our cognitive and physical resources. This framework act as an enabler for you to see the big picture simultaneously. It provides the transparency to see hidden forces in action.  
<br>
<br>
<br>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, this framework is mutable, adaptable, evolvable. Most ideas and models in entrepreneurship domain are self aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it give a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity. This framework embodies a Work In Progress attitude. This framework itself accepts its possible weakness. Everything about it can be changed and designed to suit the idiosyncrasy of user and the complexity of the context. Secondly, the structure of the framework should be seen as a scaffold. A scaffold is a temporary structure used to support development of a structure. It is not meant to be permanent. Existing prescriptive models and frameworks proposes permanent structures that end up being inflexible. This framework is not designed as a permanent structure but as impermanent scaffold that enable emergence. Further, this framework is an adaptive system. An adaptive system involves designing the elements of a system to find by themselves the solution of the problem. Like this, when the problem changes, the elements are able to dynamically find a new solution(Gershenson, 2017). Existing prescriptive models are ignorant of the possibility of its own mutability.
<br>
<br>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, this framework promotes effective learning and transfer that reflects in the structure of the framework itself. It encapsulates various complexity friendly functional dispositions into a single framework so that an ecology of ideas in its dynamics will transfer to the users, not just one or two ideas or a process. Further, learning something at one point of time and using it adaptively at a different temporal decision context is extremely challenging. This is because isolated ideas doesn't sustain without connecting with a meaningful preexisting knowledge. Without the existence of meaningful coherence it is very difficult to transfer our learning to the adaptive, unknown and emergent contexts. This Framework does three things: 1) It gives a permanent position, a meaningful coherent structure in which you can build-on, place and connect newly learned ideas and models 2) It forces constant updation. It enables and encourages you to learn, unlearn, add, remove, design, create, combine, remix, recombine and customize solutions to suit the ever changing dynamics 3) It will enable and encourages you to design your own emergent solutions for learning and transfer problem rather than attempting to prescribe any one-size-fits-all advise. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, this framework has inbuilt elements of Immunity against Cognitive Hijacking, Disciplinary Darkness &amp; Certainty Merchants. Human rationality is bounded. In a complex and uncertain world we make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. This results in the tendency of the human brain to solve problems in the most simple and straight-forward way rather than utilizing more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This human weakness is often exploited by certainty merchants who comes up with confident advise and one-size-fits-all models. Further, people with disciplinary/domain commitments become more committed to disciplinary/domain boundaries and methods aligning perfectly with legacy incentive structures over time. I would like to label this as a kind of cognitive hijacking were the agents evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential is being compromised because of strong preexisting one-size-fits-all models and other commitments. This framework is designed to create default immunity against Cognitive Hijacking. The meta-dispositions are intended to scan the phase space for potential  elements of bounded rationality and fixation errors that can prevent exploration and effective self-organization.&nbsp;</p>

</strong><br>
<br>The definition of complexity is by itself context dependent. Its usefulness depends mostly on the domain and specific problems in question. This further add to the difficulty in providing a universal definition of complexity. In-order to have a generic definition applicable to all contexts it is necessary to have adequate flexibility. Bruce Edmonds proposes a meta level and accommodative definition of complexity i.e: 
<br>
<br>“That property of a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its overall behavior, even when given almost complete information about its atomic components and their inter-relations.”.(Edmonds, 1999)
<br>
<br>According to him this is a very general definition, which is intended to have different interpretations in different contexts, especially with respect to the phrase “difficult to formulate its overall behavior”
<br>
<br>Melanie Mitchell attempts to propose a much more specific definition of the term complex system: a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution. (Mitchell, 2009)
<br>
<br> 
<br><strong>Understanding by distinction
<br></strong> 
<br>Apart from definition, One of the best ways to understand the nature of complexity is to find how it is different from other systems like e.g. simple and complicated. Complexity as a field of scientific inquiry was explained well by such a distinction developed by American mathematician Warren Weaver in his paper called Science and Complexity(1948). Weaver divided the problems of interest in science into three categories. 
<br>
<br>The first category is called Problems of Simplicity. These are problems in which two things are related to each other. These problems are characterized by just a few variables and relations between them.The problems of simplicity was solved by science by developing experimental and analytical methods for handling problems in which one variable, say a gas pressure, depends primarily upon a second quantity, eg, the volume of the gas. These problems are characterized by the fact that the behavior of the first quantity can be described with a some degree of accuracy by taking into account only its dependence upon the second variable and by ignoring negligible influence of other factors. 
<br><br><br>He calls the second category problems of Disorganized Complexity. According to him a problem of disorganized complexity “is a problem in which the number of variables is very large, and one in which each of the many variables has a behavior which is individually erratic, or perhaps totally unknown. However, in spite of this helter-skelter, or unknown, behavior of all the individual variables, the system as a whole possesses certain orderly and analyzable average properties. These are understood through taking averages over the large set of variables while ignoring or assuming very little interaction among the variables. Example of such systems are ideal gas (as discussed in thermodynamics) and random coin tosses (as discussed in probability theory).  
<br>
<br>
<br>In addition to “problems of simplicity” that are solvable with hard sciences and “disorganized complexity” that can be dealt with statistics and probability, Weaver introduced a third kind called problems of organized complexity. These are problems that involve a moderate to large number of variables. But the key here is that, due to their strong nonlinear interactions, the variables cannot be meaningfully averaged. Weaver characterized these as "problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole", such as a biological or societal system.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Complexity and Entrepreneurship<br></strong><br>Entrepreneurship comes under Weaver's third category, organized complexity. It is widely recognized as a complex and highly uncertain process(Lichtenstein et al., 2007; Schindehutte &amp; Morris, 2009). Even though this is widely recognized among scholars, entrepreneurship is often falsely depicted as an individual activity that takes place in a perfect market. In most cases, the role of the individual entrepreneur is exaggerated in such representation. Complex domains like entrepreneurship exhibit several features which cannot be taken account by most currently existing reductionist models and perspectives.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Following are some of the major characteristics of a complex system(or&nbsp;complex adaptive system) with entrepreneurship as an example.
</strong><br>&nbsp;<br><br>1. <strong>Heterogeneous agents/components/variables:</strong> Complex systems consist of a large number of elements that in themselves can be simple. Further, these elements can be heterogeneous. Heterogeneity means consisting of dissimilar or diverse ingredients or constituents. A complex system consists of a number of heterogeneous agents, and each of those agents are with unique dispositions. <br><br>Heterogeneity of entrepreneurship may manifest in following dimension, which are by themselves complex systems; entrepreneur, cognition, skills, disposition, idea, customer, teams, investors, venture capitalists, government, bureaucracy, consultants, location, networks, resources, market, technology, law, policy, connection, trust, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>2. Non-Linear dynamics and interaction among&nbsp;elements(agents/components/variables):</strong> <br>Complex systems are dynamic entities that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. The distinction between endogenous and exogenous dynamics is not always clear; and, because of their many components, the outcomes of manipulations of the system may differ depending on relatively small differences in starting conditions.(Cumming and Collier, 2005). In a complex system dynamics is manifested by heterogeneous agents interacting with one another in a non-linear and continuous way. Even if specific agents may only interact with a few others, the impact of these interactions are propagated throughout the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly agents co-evolve with one another (Anderson, 1999). Through this interaction agents strives to improve its fitness with the environment but the outcome of these attempts depends on the disposition and behaviors of other agents (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003).<br><br>In entrepreneurship agents interact with others in a non-linear manner. Entrepreneurs may at the same time have to interact with his team, investors, customers, government, etc.<br><br><br><strong>3. Feedback:&nbsp;</strong>Complex systems are characterized by feedback loops in which the product of the process is necessary for the process itself. A feedback loop is a circular arrangement of causally connected elements in which each element affects the next, until the last feeds back into the first element, thus completing the loop (Walby, 2003). Change in a variable results in either an amplification (positive feedback) or a dampening (negative feedback) of that change(Kastens et al., 2009).<br><br>Many scholars also stress on the non-linearity aspect of feedback loops, calling it non-linear feedback loops(Juarrero, 1999: 47-48).&nbsp; According to  Ralph Stacey "organizations are nonlinear,
network feedback systems and it therefore follows
logically that the fundamental properties of such
systems should apply to organizations."(Stacey, 1995). Example from entrepreneurship includes; Customer feedback, stakeholder feedback, tax policy impacting entrepreneurship and feeds back into either success or failure of business, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>The identification of a feedback loop in this way does not necessarily imply the group participants can agree about whether the self-sustaining nature
<br>of the feedback is vicious or virtuous. Viciousness or virtuousness is a point of view,
<br>whereas the existence of self-sustaining feedback may be agreed by all.
<br>The existence of feedback is likely to be of significance for the group. Two possibilities for feedback exist: positive or self-sustaining feedback – either as a vicious
<br>cycle or virtuous cycle; and negative controlling feedback – where any action taken
<br>results in a tendency for the situation to return to its original state. Feedback is
<br>of significance because it represents the potential for dynamics in the situation –
<br>changes over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>4. Emergence(+ Irreducibility, Non-proportionality, Butterfly Effect):</strong> Complex adaptive systems show emergent properties. Emergent properties refers
to a characteristic that is found across the system but which individual parts
of the system do not themselves hold. According to David Elder-Vass, if a thing can have properties or capabilities that are not possessed by its parts, such properties are called emergent properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergent higher order behaviour cannot simply be derived by aggregating behaviour at the level of the elements(<strong>Irreducibility</strong>). This is because the whole is more than the sum of its parts when it comes of complexity.&nbsp; Another feature of emergent property is <strong>non-proportionality</strong>. The effect of an input is not proportional to the strength of that input. Due to the non-proportionality, <strong>small inputs might have a large impact</strong><strong>,</strong> whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome.&nbsp; Edward Lorenz developed the idea of <strong>butterfly effect</strong> to conceptualize this sensitive dependence of a system on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.<br><br><br><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305349662_Emergence_and_Emergents_in_Entrepreneurship_Complexity_Science_Insights_into_New_Venture_Creation" class="text-primary" target="_blank">In entrepreneurship, an opportunity (product, organization, market)
can come to be in the absence of deliberate planning.</a>&nbsp;Entrepreneurship scholars (Katz and Gartner 1988; Gartner,
1993) had identified the importance of emergence as a frame for understanding entrepreneurial complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;An entrepreneurial venture or a startup is an example of emergent property of large number of components like intention, cognition, various skills, various stakeholders, location, experts, policy networks, technology, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Other examples(macro level) are innovations that bread other innovations(e.g. internet, google by democratizing information access), technologies that result
in new disruptive responses, emergence of new markets and new business models(e.g. app store, android) and collaborative activities(social media, collaboration apps).<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>5. Self-Organisation:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Self-organization is used to refer to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level. ’ (Anzola et al., 2017, (Ska˚r 2003; Kauffman 1995)). It is a bottom-up process where complex
organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of
lower-level entities. The final product is the result of nonlinear
interactions rather than planning and design, and is not known
a priori.
This can be contrasted with the top-down approaches where planning precedes implementation, and the
desired final system is known by design.&nbsp;In self-organisation there is no hierarchy of command and control and there is no planning or managing, but there is a constant re-organizing to find
the best fit with the environment.&nbsp;The system is continually self
organizing through the process of emergence and feedback.<br>&nbsp;<br>Further, emergence happen naturally from the interactions within a complex system; they do not need to be imposed top down/centrally/externally. For example, termites are known to construct the highest structures on the planet relative to the size of the builders. Yet there is no chief executive among termites, no architect termite, and no blueprint. Each termite acts locally, following only a few simple shared rules of behaviour, within a context of other termites also acting locally. The termite mound emerges from this process of self organisation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>We can find self-organisation as a important character of market, business and entrepreneurship. For example, we can see the venture as self-organized system emerged to satisfy customer demands. According to Peltoniemi &amp; Vuori(2004), "the formation of a
business ecosystem is a process where participants are gathered voluntarily and without
external or internal leader. Goals are set in local interactions, where companies negotiate and
create new order."<br><br><strong>6. Fuzzy boundaries and Nested-embedded complexity:&nbsp;</strong>In complicated system like a car or algorithm, boundaries are fixed and well defined. Complex systems are systems typically characterized with fuzzy boundaries. Membership of a complex system can change, and agents can simultaneously be members of several systems. E.g. investor could be a family member or she might invest in other companies, or join as a startup team member. Complex systems are also embedded/nested in other systems which are constantly interacting with one another. For example, an entrepreneur is a system nested/embedded itself with other complex systems like startup team, customers, market, investors, family, suppliers, partners, government, country and society itself.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>7. Dynamics of evolution: Evolution, Adaptation, Co-evolution, Path Dependence:&nbsp;</strong><br><strong><br></strong>Coevolution refers to the simultaneous evolution of entities and their environments,
whether these entities are organisms or organizations (Baum &amp; Singh, 1994).&nbsp; It encompasses the twin notions of interdependency and mutual adaptation, with the idea that species or organizations evolve in relation to their environments, while at the same time these environments evolve in relation to them.<br><br>Complex systems are part of a broader environment. So as the environment changes, systems change to 
<br>ensure best fit. This in turn influences the wider environment, and creates a constant cycle of change as the system develops to adapt to the&nbsp;environment and the environment changes as&nbsp; a result of system alterations. <br>Systems are embedded within other systems and co-evolve. The evolution of one system influences and is influenced by that of other systems. <br>Since each agent and each system is nested within other systems, all evolving together and interacting, we cannot fully understand any of the agents or systems without reference to the others. 
<br><br><strong>Path dependence:</strong> Decisions alter the state of the world, causing changes in the system and triggering other social actors to act. The new situation then constrains the path for subsequent courses of action. Hence, choosing a path often leads to irreversible consequences that determine the fate of the system, making it history-dependent. Complex systems have memory, not located at a specific place, but
<br>distributed throughout the system. Any complex system thus has a
<br>history, and the history is of cardinal importance to the behavior of the
<br>system.<br>
<br>Complex systems have memory, not located at a specific place, but distributed throughout the system. Any complex system thus has a history, and the history is of cardinal importance to the behavior of the system.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;<strong>Adaptation</strong>: All these systems adapt—that is, change their behavior to improve their chances of survival or success—through learning or evolutionary processes.   Complex systems are adaptive. They can (re)organize their internal structure without the intervention of an external agent.  What can we learn from complexity, Prof Paul Cilliers, Emergence, March 2000<br><br><br><strong>8. Attractor behaviour
<br></strong>Complexity science notes a specific type of pattern called an attractor. Attractor patterns provide comparatively simple understanding of what at first seems to be extremely complex behaviour. For example, in psychotherapy, clients are more likely to accept a counsellor's advice when it is framed in ways that enhance their core sense of autonomy, integrity, and ideals.18 These are underlying attractors within the complex and ever changing system of a person's detailed behaviour. Relatively simple attractor patterns have been shown in share prices in a financial market,6 biological systems (such as beat to beat variation in heart rate19), human behaviour (such as Mr Henderson's frequent consulting), and social systems (such as nurses' staffing patterns on a hospital ward20).
Doctors' behaviour is notoriously difficult to influence, but, as we shall illustrate in the article on organisational applications in this series,21 attractor <br>metaphors can be used to identify potentially fruitful areas for work.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>9.

<br>equilibrium.<br><br><br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Domains like entrepreneurship exemplify all of the previously listed characteristics of a complex system. Following are some of the characteristics of decision making in real world.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>*&nbsp;</strong>Real world decisions are<strong> context dependent</strong>: Every complex decision problems are essentially unique, and every solution to such a problem is an one-shot event.<br><br><strong>*&nbsp;</strong>Real world decisions are <strong>4E; i.e. embodied, embedded, enactive, extended.</strong> This means it is essentially impossible to understand(or effect) real world decisions by <strong>cognitive reductionism</strong>.&nbsp;Simon used the <strong>scissors analogy</strong> to visualize the real world, where one blade of the scissor represents cognition of humans and the other represents the environment",<br><br>* Real world decision making in complex domains can be understood at <strong>individual level and domain level</strong>. Decision making complexity in domains like entrepreneurship may manifest as individual and domain related.  Learning to use a new software or drive a car may initially feel complex but eventually it will subside. On the other hand domain complexity is inherent to the domain in question itself. e.g. entrepreneurship, climate change , etc.&nbsp;<br>
<br>* Real world decisions <strong>doesn't have boundaries</strong>. Categories like Simple, complicated, complex, chaotic Or  certainty, risk,uncertainty, etc. even though discussed and studied separately, may appear part of a real world decision context. This means a decision maker need sense making effort to use appropriate tools according to the evolving demands of the context.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world problems also <strong>doesn't respect socially constructed disciplinary boundaries</strong>. This awareness may help the decision maker to expand the search space. (Andy Penaluna)<br>
<br>* Real world decisions involve <strong>ambiguity and uncertainty </strong>that limit the scope for identifying a rationally optimum decision and allow for a range of <strong>competing proposals and preferences</strong> to claim credibility (Lyles, 1981). Further, we rarely&nbsp;make a decision after possessing all the <strong>facts, </strong>and as a corollary, In practice, we rarely make a decision based on all the <strong>facts </strong>in our possession.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>* </strong>Real world decisions or experience of the <strong>past may not inform present</strong> challenges because <strong>problems or contexts never repeats</strong>. Past <strong>experience is invalid</strong> when something is being done for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world decisions involves a <strong>trade off between efficiency and evolvability</strong>: In a world where landscapes can change radically in a short space of time, the power of a decision lies in its inherent adaptability/evolvability, not the accuracy of the predictions on which it is based. 'The danger of optimum decision making via developing expertise is that of being wedded to a particular technology that may go extinct. The expert needs a network of people &amp; other experts to balance his or her perspective and help frame the question 
<br><br>* Real world <strong>decisions may change the landscape</strong>, particularly in domains of many interacting agents. E.g. The Hawthorne effect. Unintended consequences of decisions are a tangent dimension to this issue. E.g Cobra Effect.&nbsp;Further, people in one's network affects his/her decision making and are in-turn affected by decisions of other agents.&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world decisions <strong>may not have clear measures of success</strong>. It may be absent, conflicting or vague. On the other hand If we introduce an external metric, that metric may hijack the decision agenda away from ecological validity to metric validity.&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world decisions are <strong>not deterministic or an individual driven</strong>:&nbsp; Decision making in the real world is <strong>distributed across various stakeholders</strong>(eg. Investors, co-founder, family), institutions(government agencies, partner companies), artifacts(software, notebook, Mobile) etc. In real world contexts like entrepreneurship there are multiple heterogeneous stakeholders with diverse and conflicting beliefs, preferences, and goals. Success of an action in such a decision context requires continued stakeholder engagement, during and after its execution.&nbsp;<br><br>*Real world decision problems are <strong>Interdependent and changing</strong>: In a complex domain decision makers are not confronted with
problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. (Ackoff 1978).&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>* Real world decisions may have <strong>heterogeneous reasons</strong>: An economics view of decisions assume the existence of a rational decision maker. But in real world complex contexts decisions are often not what they appear to be. A decision presented as a technical decision may in fact be political, or personal.&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world decisions involve and active <strong>role for emotions</strong>: Emotion is an intrinsic part human decision making in real context.&nbsp;Research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful and sometimes beneficial drivers of decision making.(Lerner et al. 2015).(Here predictable doesn't mean complex events, but predictability about individual decisions.)<br>
<br>* Real world decision are <strong>Irreversible and (History)path dependen</strong>t: Our decisions are interconnected, it will influence the future decision landscape, opening up some choices, and constraining others. In the same way, It is also influenced and framed by the actions of others. 
<br>
<br>* Real world decision are <strong>influenced by timing</strong>: The right timing is one of the most important aspect of decision making in complexity.&nbsp; According to Bill Gross the single biggest reason why startups succeed is timing. Since complex domains exhibit dynamics of interaction and evolution (&amp; co-evolution) the opportunity structure changes all the time. E.g.We must go to the airport at the right time to catch a plane, we may miss the flight because of a traffic block.&nbsp;<br><br>* Real world decisions<strong> may be impulsive</strong>. Studies have proven that a substantive entrepreneurial behaviors may also occur without ex-ante reasoning (Kautonen et al., 2015. Hunt and Lerner, 2018; Wiklund, 2019).
<br><br>* Real world decisions <strong>may be based on intuition</strong>: This may include ordinary intuition, expert intuition or strategic intuition. Ordinary intuition is just a feeling, a gut instinct. Expert intuition is the one developed by experts by years of practice, and Strategic intuition is the intuition that happens when
one face a new situation.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Bounded Rationality 
<br></strong>
<br>In a complex and uncertain world, humans make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Herbert Simon (1955, 1956, 1957) thus argued that humans have a bounded rationality. He suggested that the complexity of the environment and humans’ limited cognitive system make maximization impossible in most real-life decision-making situations. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Human bounded rationality in a complex environment involves usage of simple rules than complicated models, otherwise heuristics and biases. Because of the lack of adequate information we use such simple rules of thumb for rendering a judgment or making a decision.  Another way to look at this is using the concept of "cognitive miser" coined by Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor in 1984 to describe the tendency of the human brain to problem solve in the most simple and straight-forward ways rather than utilizing more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This simplification is neither good nor bad but depends upon the domain(environment) , and expertise of the decision maker. Its effectiveness in complex decision contexts are proven to be effective particularly when compared to formal models.  According to decision scientists like Gerd Gigerenzer and his fast and frugal heuristics program, If the heuristic’s structural bias is well-suited to the task environment, then the bias of that heuristic may be an advantage for making accurate judgments rather than a liability. This perspective believes this form of decision mechanism is evolutionarily adapted to deal with complexity  Herbert Simon(1947) refers to this act of doing the best we can as satisficing behaviour, refers to the less than optimal choices which can result when making nonprogrammed decisions due to decision makers’ limited cognitive capacities and lack of time and energy.  
<br>
<br>Bounded rationality have a multitude of effects on human decision making. One of the most significant dimentions is selective perception of information. It suggests that there is always far more information in our objective environments than we can perceive or attend to. Thus, perceptions must be strongly guided by anticipations. The main point here is not necessarily bias but top-down processing: perception is influenced by schemas and other mental constructs. As March and Simon (1958) noted, under conditions of complexity and imperfect information, decisions are made on the basis of selective perception and identification with  sub-goals
<br>. 
<br>
<br>Further, we see only the things which we are looking at, which was demonstrated by the concept of inattentional blindness coined by Arien Mack and Irvin Rock. It is defined as the event in which an individual fails to perceive an unexpected stimulus that is in plain sight. Many instances of Invisible Gorilla Test conducted by Daniel Simons and others found evidence of Inattentional blindness. A much similar concept Change blindness is also a perceptual phenomenon that occurs when a change in a visual stimulus is introduced and the observer does not notice it. 
<br>
<br> 
<br>Finally, human bounded rationality also comes with a large number of recorded biases. Wikipedia page on human biases as of today lists about more than 190 biases which are all part of this category. For example, We use the availability-heuristic which is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. We have confirmation bias, which is a tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms our beliefs or hypotheses. We are subject to framing effects. We frame our own decision contexts and we are also subject to framing of environment and other people, which anchors our cognition and decision in a particular way, which is also called anchoring effect.
