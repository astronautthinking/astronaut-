It is essential that solutions designed for complex domains like entrepreneurship must consider dynamics of complexity like non-linearity, inter-relatedness, emergent property, etc. Regardless of this, most of the dominant entrepreneurship perspectives still assume that entrepreneurship is the same all over the world. The proposed solutions and methods are often developed without any consideration to many of the non-linear dynamics that are inherent to complex domains like entrepreneurship. They usually ignore the massive diversity and uniqueness of personal, historical, cultural, institutional, social, and spatial contexts. While entrepreneurship operates at the evolutionary edge of social emergence, most of the current thinkers and their models never truly acknowledged its massive uncertainty and complexity. Further, the need for appropriate methods is neglected in favor of reductionistic one size fits all prescriptive models, cliche advice, and incrementalism.</i></b></div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><i style><b>In the following part, I am introducing a complexity science-informed design solution to aid entrepreneurial actions. This is based on the scientific understanding that open complex adaptive systems like entrepreneurship have a tendency to self-organize under various constraints (Kauffman, 1995) . Deriving from that, the framework is built on the premise that self-organization and design are complementary pairs (Kelso et al, 2016). In the first part of the presentation, I will discuss complexity, the nature of entrepreneurial complexity, the implication of complexity on human decision-making and expertise. Then I will discuss why existing entrepreneurship prescriptive models are inadequate for dealing with complexity. After that I will introduce three important components of the framework; The first is about setting the right complexity based world view (Dent, 1999), for which  an Ecological world view is adopted (Ulanowicz, 2009; Gibson, 2014; Capra, 1996); The second is about the idea of self-organization, where I will elaborate on reasons why effectuation is an ideal praxis for entrepreneurial self-organization. The third is about</b></i><span style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">&nbsp;<b><i>constraints-based dynamic design, an idea adapted from the Constraints-Led approach to sports coaching (Davids et al, 2008) and Cynefin framework (Snowden and Boone, 2007; Cynefin, 2021). The constraints-based dynamic design of the framework uses Alicia Juarrero's(1999) conception of Context-free and Context-sensitive constraints to enable the entrepreneur to self-organize to find better solutions by themselves.</i></b></span></div><div><br></div><div><b><i>The framework is created as an integrative and harmonizing design solution that embodies dispositions like holism, evolvability, diversity, adaptability, learnability, agency, etc. which are all essential for dealing with a complex-emergent decision domain like entrepreneurship.</i></b></div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div></h4>\n                <div class=\"mbr-section-btn align-center\" mbr-if=\"showButtons\" mbr-buttons mbr-theme-style=\"display-4\">\n                    <a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://mobiri.se\">LEARN MORE</a>\n                    <a class=\"btn btn-primary-outline\" href=\"https://mobiri.se\">LIVE DEMO</a>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</section>",

It is affected by a large number of interconnected and interacting variables (Bygrave and Minniti, 2000; Giannetti and Simonov,2009), and depends on numerous contextual factors (Welter, 2011; Audretsch. et. al, 2012). This may include factors like<b>;</b>&nbsp;<b>socioeconomic status&nbsp;</b>(Giacomin et al. 2011), <b>education&nbsp;</b>(Millan et al. 2014), <b>gender&nbsp;</b>(Warnecke, 2013; Marlow and Martinez, 2018), <b>time&nbsp;</b>(Klyver et al., 2018; Bird and West, 1997), <b>history&nbsp;</b>(Wadhwani, 2016), <b>location&nbsp;</b>(Audretsch et al., 2012; Storey and Johnson, 2002), <b>stakeholders&nbsp;</b>(Dew and Sarasvathy, 2007), <b>cognition&nbsp;</b>(Dew, et al. 2015; Grégoire et al. 2011; Ward, 2004), <b>intentions&nbsp;</b>(Krueger et al., 2000; Fayolle and Liñán,2014; Krueger, 2017), <b>skills&nbsp;</b>(Lazear, 2004; Hsieh et al, 2017; Oosterbeek et al, 2010), <b>opportunity recognition&nbsp;</b>(Singh, 2001; Lumpkin and Lichtenstein, 2005), <b>acquisition of resources&nbsp;</b>(Leung et al. 2006; Martens et al. 2007), <b>product development&nbsp;</b>(Giardino, et al.,2014), <b>marketing&nbsp;</b>(Lam and Harker, 2015), etc, to list only a few. <br><br>One of the major implications of such complexity in entrepreneurship is the inherent uncertainty when it comes to decision-making (Knight, 1921 ). In complex domains like entrepreneurship, past behavior cases may not help us in predicting the future. To predict an event accurately, we need to have a stable system with adequate data. In the case of complex emergent systems, history never repeats. This is why when studying complex domains like entrepreneurship it is essential to use a complexity lens (Berger and Kuckertz, 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In the following chapters I will discuss two of my core arguments. <br><br>1. What is complexity and Why entrepreneurship is called a complex decision domain: In this part, I will explore the nature of complexity by looking into scientific and also decision-making implications of complexity. I will then list down some of the core features of entrepreneurial complexity.<br><br>2. Problems with existing models: Although entrepreneurship is a complex field most of the existing prescriptive action models like lean-startup or business planning, etc are created and used without any consideration to the essence of complexity. In this part, I will list some of the core weaknesses of existing entrepreneurship models when dealing with complexity.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 1\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.

Its usefulness depends mostly on the domain and specific problems in question. This further adds to the difficulty in providing a universal definition of complexity. To have a generic definition applicable to all contexts, it is necessary to have adequate flexibility. Bruce Edmonds proposes a meta-level and accommodative definition of complexity i.e: “That property of a language expression which makes it difficult to formulate its overall behavior, even when given almost complete information about its atomic components and their inter-relations” (Edmonds, 1995). According to him, this is a very general definition, which is intended to have different interpretations in different contexts. <br><br>Melanie Mitchell(2009) also agrees with the above observation by suggesting that \"various(complex) systems are quite different\", but adds that, \"viewed at an abstract level they have some intriguing properties in common\". They are; Complex collective behavior: It is the collective action of vast numbers of components that give rise to the complex, hard-to-predict, and changing patterns of behavior that fascinate us; Signaling and information processing: Complex systems produce and use information and signals from both their internal and external environments; and Adaptation: All these systems adapt—that is, change their behavior to improve their chances of survival or success—through learning or evolutionary processes. Combining this observation, she proposes her definition of a complex system, i.e. \"a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution\" (Mitchell, 2009). For an explanation from the entrepreneurship field, Benyamin Lichtenstein(2000) suggested that four assumptions characterize complex systems. They are; Dynamics—Complex systems are dynamic and constantly changing; Irreducibility of elements: Elements are Irreducible due to the entwined nature of the elements; Interdependencies—The causality in complex systems cannot be described by linear models, as the causality is interdependent; Non-proportionality—Small inputs might have a large impact, whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome. <br><br><b>Understanding by distinction <br></b><br>Apart from definition, One of the best ways to understand the nature of complexity is to find how it is different from other systems like e.g. simple and complicated. Complexity as a field of scientific inquiry was explained well by such a distinction made by American mathematician Warren Weaver in his paper called Science and Complexity(1948).<br><br>Weaver(1991) divided the problems of interest in science into three categories. The first category is called Problems of Simplicity. These are problems in which two things are related to each other. These problems are characterized by just a few variables and relations between them. The problems of simplicity were solved by science by developing experimental and analytical methods for handling problems in which one variable, say a gas pressure, depends primarily upon a second quantity, eg, the volume of the gas. These problems are characterized by the fact that the behavior of the first quantity can be described with some degree of accuracy by taking into account only its dependence upon the second variable and by ignoring the negligible influence of other factors. He calls the second category problems of Disorganized Complexity. According to him a problem of disorganized complexity “is a problem in which the number of variables is very large, and one in which each of the many variables has a behavior which is individually erratic, or perhaps totally unknown. However, despite the unknowns, the behavior of all the individual variables, the system as a whole possesses certain orderly and analyzable average properties. These are understood through taking averages over the large set of variables while ignoring or assuming very little interaction among the variables. Examples of such systems are ideal gas (as discussed in thermodynamics) and random coin tosses(as discussed in probability theory). In addition to “problems of simplicity” that are solvable with hard sciences and “disorganized complexity” that can be dealt with statistics and probability, Weaver introduced a third kind called problems of organized complexity. These are problems that involve a moderate to a large number of variables. But the key here is that, due to their strong nonlinear interactions, the variables cannot be meaningfully averaged. Weaver characterized these as \"problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole\", such as a biological or societal system. The third category \"organized complexity\" is the representation of the type of complex system we are talking about in this paper.<br><br>Another powerful model that gives a lot of clarity from distinction is a sense-making framework developed by Dave Snowden (Snowden, 2010) called Cynefin. It differentiates between three kinds of systems (Van Beurden et al, 2013): Ordered systems(simple/ complicated) in which cause and effect relationships are either clear or discoverable through analysis; Chaotic systems in which turbulence prevails and immediate stabilizing action is required; and Complex systems in which the only way to understand the system is to interact. In a complicated context, at least one right answer exists. \"In a complex context, however, right answers can’t be ferreted out. It’s like the difference between, say, a Ferrari and the Brazilian rainforest. Ferraris are complicated machines, but an expert mechanic can take one apart and reassemble it without changing a thing. The car is static, and the whole is the sum of its parts. The rain-forest, on the other hand, is in constant flux—a species becomes extinct, weather patterns change, an agricultural project reroutes a water source—and the whole is far more than the sum of its parts\" (Snowden and Boone, 2007). <br><br><br><b>Complexity and Entrepreneurship <br></b><br>It has to be noted that entrepreneurship has components of all decision types(ordered, complex and chaotic Or problems of simplicity, disorganized complexity, organized complexity). But the core aspect of venture creation comes mostly under Weaver's third category, organized complexity; or in other words a complex domain. Even though scholars have widely recognized entrepreneurship as a complex and highly uncertain process (Lichtenstein et al, 2007; Brouwer, 2000), it is still popularly depicted as an individual activity (Drakopoulou, 2007) that takes place in a perfect market. In most cases, the role of the individual entrepreneur is exaggerated in such representation (Gaddefors and Anderson, 2017). Complex domains like entrepreneurship exhibit several features which cannot be taken into account by most currently existing reductionist models and perspectives (Berger and Kuckertz, 2016). <br><br><br><b>Following are some of the major characteristics of a complex system(or complex adaptive system) with entrepreneurship as an example. It is important to keep in mind that these characteristics are not separate from each other, and each requires all others for any attempt to explain it. <br></b><br><br><b>1. A large number of heterogeneous agents/components/elements: <br></b><br>Complex systems consist of a large number of elements that in themselves can be simple. When the number of elements is relatively small, the behavior of the elements can often be given a formal description in conventional terms. However, when the number becomes sufficiently large, conventional means not only become impractical, they also cease to assist in any understanding of the system (Cilliers, 2002). Further, these elements can be heterogeneous, in that they differ in their behavior, location, history, or other properties. Such heterogeneity, in turn, can have far-reaching impacts on the functioning of the system. For example, different species within an ecosystem will have been in the ecosystem for different lengths of time, possess different functional traits, and occupy different niches (Fisher, 2020). <br><br>Heterogeneity of entrepreneurship (Spilling, 2008) may manifest in many dimensions, which are by themselves complex; e.g. entrepreneur, cognition, skills, disposition, idea, customer, teams, investors, venture capitalists, government, bureaucracy, consultants, location, networks, resources, market, technology, law, policy, connection, trust, etc. The importance and inevitability of heterogeneity in entrepreneurship is evident from scholarly works focusing on various perspectives to approach heterogeneity (Davidsson, 2007; Breitenecker and Harms, 2010; Dufays and Huybrechts, 2016). <br><br><b>2. Non-Linear dynamics and interaction among elements(agents/components/variables): <br></b><br>According to Cilliers(2002), a large number of elements are necessary, but not sufficient. In order to constitute a complex system, the elements have to interact, and this interaction must be dynamic. A complex system changes with time. The interactions do not have to be physical; they can also be thought of as the transference of information. This is also evident from Herbert Simon's definition of a complex system; ie. \"one made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions\" (Simon 1996). Secondly, the interactions are non-linear. A large system of linear elements can usually be collapsed into an equivalent system that is very much smaller. Non-linearity also guarantees that small causes can have large results, and vice versa. Further, even if specific agents may only interact with a few others, the impact of these interactions are propagated throughout the system. Through this interaction, agents strive to improve their fitness with the environment but the outcome of these attempts depends on the disposition and behaviors of other agents (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). <br><br>In entrepreneurship, agents interact with others in a non-linear manner. For example, an entrepreneur at the same time has to interact with his team, investors, customers, partners, government, etc. He/She gets feedback from the interaction, which triggers more interaction. These interactions will not follow a certain format or order; in other words, it is non-linear. Further, studies have also found that successful entrepreneurship ecosystems outperform others due in part to more amplifying and less dampening of nonlinear interactions (Han et al,2021). <br><br><br><b>3. Feedback Loop: <br></b><br>Complex systems are characterized by feedback loops in which the product of the process is necessary for the process itself. A feedback loop is “a circular arrangement of causally connected elements, so that each element has an effect on the next, until the last “feeds back” the effect into the first element of the cycle” (Capra 1997, 56). Change in a variable result in either an amplification (positive feedback) or a dampening (negative feedback) of that change (Kastens et al., 2009). Both kinds(positive---enhancing, stimulating or negative---detracting, inhibiting) are necessary. The technical term for this aspect of a complex system is recurrency (Cilliers, 2002). Further, when the interactions of large numbers of components involve positive feedback loops, some behaviors self amplify, quickly crowding out others. Groups of components become locked into self-reinforcing feedback cycles that lead to predictable collective behavior (Anderson, 1999). <br><br>Many scholars also stress the non-linearity aspect of feedback loops, calling them non-linear feedback loops (Juarrero, 1999: 47-48). According to Ralph Stacey(1995) organizations are nonlinear network feedback systems and it, therefore, follows logically that the fundamental properties of such systems should apply to organizations. Examples from entrepreneurship include explicit feedback like customer feedback (Eisenmann et al., 2012), stakeholder feedback, and long-term positive or negative feedback. At the macro-level, entrepreneurship is impacted by monetary policy, social climate, etc, and will impact the same by looping back; Like that economic activity promotes entrepreneurship and innovation activities, and entrepreneurship enhances economic activity by looping back (Galindo and Méndez, 2014). Feedback is also discussed in entrepreneurship literature as the one aiding effective decision-making (Haynie and Shepherd, 2007).  <br><br><br><b>4. Emergence or emergent property:<br></b><br>Complex systems show emergent property. Emergence is a systemic process through which properties and or structures come into being that are unexpected, given the known attributes of component agents and environmental forces (Lichtenstein and McKelvey, 2011). Emergent properties refer to a characteristic that is found across the system but which individual parts of the system do not themselves hold. Other-words, if a thing can have properties or capabilities that are not possessed by its parts, such properties are called emergent properties (Elder-Vass, 2014). The emergent higher-order behavior cannot simply be derived by aggregating behavior at the level of the elements (Irreducibility, Beckage, 2013). This is because the whole is more than the sum of its parts when it comes to complexity. Another feature of emergent property is non-proportionality (Lichtenstein and Mendenhall, 2002). The effect of input is not proportional to the strength of that input. Due to the non-proportionality, small inputs might have a large impact, whereas large inputs might hardly change the outcome. <br><br>Entrepreneurship scholars for long had identified the importance of emergence as a frame for understanding entrepreneurial complexity (Katz and Gartner 1988; Gartner, 1993; Lichtenstein et al, 2006; Fuller et al, 2008). An emergent property is manifested in entrepreneurship in many different ways. At the basic level entrepreneurial venture or a startup itself is an example of emergent property of a large number of factors like intention, cognition, various skills, various stakeholders, location, experts, policy, networks, technology, etc. Further, emergence is manifested at the macro level when innovations breed other innovations(e.g. internet, google by democratizing information access), technologies that result in new disruptive responses, the emergence of new markets and new business models(e.g. app store, android), and collaborative activities(social media, collaboration apps), etc. <br><br>The implication of emergent property is that an opportunity(product, organization, market) can come into reality in the absence of deliberate planning. Users often adapt products to support tasks that designers never intended (Johnson, 2006). E.g. Instagram was started as an HTML5 supported location-based service; Facebook was started as an app to compare two people’s pictures and the rate which one was more attractive.<br><br><br><b>5. Self-Organisation:<br></b><br>Self-organization refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level (Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r, 2003; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. The final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and design; and it is not known a priori (De Roo, 2016). This can be contrasted with the top-down approaches where planning precedes implementation, and the desired final system is known by design. In self-organization, there is no hierarchy of command and control and there is no planning or managing, but there is a constant re-organizing to find the best fit with the environment. The system is continually self-organizing through the process of emergence and feedback. It changes the relationships between the distributed elements of the system under influence of both the external environment and the history of the system (Cilliers, 2002). Further, emergence happens naturally from the interactions within a complex system; they do not need to be imposed top-down in a centralized way. For example, termites are known to construct the highest structures on the planet relative to the size of the builders. Yet there is no chief executive among termites, no architect termite, and no blueprint. Each termite acts locally, following only a few simple shared rules of behavior within a context of other termites also acting locally. The termite mound emerges from this process of self-organization (Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001). <br><br>We can find self-organization as an important character of the market, business, and entrepreneurship. For example, we can see the venture as a self-organized system that emerged to satisfy customer demands. It can be the result of self-organization like Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001), Entrepreneurial bricolage (Baker and Nelson, 2005), User innovation (Hippel, 1988), etc. Further, according to Peltoniemi &amp; Vuori(2004), even \"the formation of a business ecosystem is a process where participants are gathered voluntarily and without external or internal leader. Goals are set in local interactions, where companies negotiate and create a new order.\" <br><br><b>6. Fuzzy boundaries and Nested-embedded complexity:<br></b><br>In a complicated system like a car or algorithm, boundaries are fixed and well defined. Complex systems are systems typically characterized by fuzzy boundaries. Membership of a complex system can change, and agents can simultaneously be members of several systems (Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001). E.g. investor could be a family member or she might invest in other companies, or join as a startup team member. <br><br>Complex systems are also embedded/nested in other systems which are constantly interacting with one another. For example, Our planet is a complex system, as is our body, the organizations that we create, or our social and economic systems (Héraud et al. 2019). When it comes to the economic system, buyers and sellers form markets and markets form economies, whereas the buyers and sellers themselves can be people or organizations formed by people (Noell, 2007). All of these are complex systems by themselves. Because of this embedded nature, it is virtually impossible to accurately mark the boundaries of one system from other systems. Further, Since each agent and each system is nested within other systems, all evolving together and interacting, we cannot fully understand any of the agents or systems without reference to the others (Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001). <br><br>An entrepreneur is a system nested/embedded itself with other complex systems like startup team, customers, market, investors, family, suppliers, partners, government, country, and society itself. In fields of study like entrepreneurship, business, organization, etc, scholars have been exploring the nested and embedded nature of multiple complex co-evolving systems (Holm,1995; Baum and Singh, 1994; Dieleman and Sachs, 2008; Ng, 2011). Scholars have also explored the contextually embedded nature of entrepreneurial actors (Baker and Welter, 2018; Autio et al, 2014; Lounsbury et al, 2019), suggesting the entangled and embedded nature of entrepreneurship to the context in which it is situated. <br><br><br><b>7. Dynamics of evolution: Evolution, Adaptation, Co-evolution, Path Dependence: <br></b><br>Complex systems follow the dynamics of evolution. The behavior of complex systems evolves from the interaction of agents at a local level without external direction or the presence of internal control (Kernick, 2006). This should not be viewed as local Darwinian processes and optimization alone (Pendleton and Brown, 2018), but also as dynamic exchanges between components and the system as a whole, impacting other complex systems. Following are some of the ways in which the dynamics of evolution manifests in complex systems. First of all, adaptation forms one of the fundamental features of evolution. All complex systems adapt—that is, change their behavior to improve their chances of survival or success—through learning or evolutionary processes (Melanie Mitchell, 2009). They can (re)organize their internal structure without the intervention of an external agent (Paul Cilliers, Emergence, March 2000). Secondly, In nature and complex systems, evolution is manifested in the form of co-evolution (Ehrlich and Raven, 1964). When organisms adapts in a reciprocal way, it will lead to Coevolution (Thompson and Cunningham, 2002). It refers to the simultaneous evolution of entities and their environments, whether these entities are organisms or organizations (Baum &amp; Singh, 1994). It encompasses the twin notions of interdependency and mutual adaptation, with the idea that species or organizations evolve in relation to their environments, while at the same time these environments evolve in relation to them (Porter, 2006). Adding to this we can take Kauffman's(1993, 237) observation that, \"all ‘evolution’ is really coevolution\". According to him, \"the true and stunning success of biology reflects the fact that organisms do not merely evolve, they coevolve both with other organisms and with a changing abiotic environment\". He argues that coevolution is at the root of self-organizing behavior, constant change in systems, the production of novel macro structures, and non-linearities. <br><br>Further, according to Cilliers(2002), Complex systems have a history. Not only do they evolve through time, but their past is co-responsible for their present behavior. This is equivalent to ideas like path dependence (Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995; lock-in's(Arthur, 1989), or Imprinting (Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007, etc. <br><br>An evolutionary perspective is indispensable from the complexity worldview of entrepreneurship. According to Cordes et al(2008), \"firms are culturally variable and evolve new cultural forms as time passes. This evolution is partly driven by entrepreneurs and other business leaders in entrepreneurial roles (Penrose, 1959; Langlois, 1998), partly by the decisions made by rank-and-file members, partly by the firm’s competitive success or failure (Alchian, 1950), and partly by cultural evolution in the larger society within which firms are embedded\". Acknowledging this centrality, evolutionary dynamics in entrepreneurship is one of the most widely explored topics among scholars. This includes meta-level exploration of the evolution of the field itself (Landström, 2020; Carlsson et al, 2013) to various other dimensions of evolutionary dynamics (Schaltegger et al. 2016; Pacheco et al., 2014; Tiwana et al., 2010; Inkpen et al., 2004; Lewin et al, 1999; Jones, 2001; Grodal et al., 2015). <br>. <br><br><b>8. Attractor behavior:<br></b><br>In a complex emergent system, an attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through. They are islands of stability in a sea of chaos. Complex systems are inherently uncertain, but, they usually settle down into one of a number of possible steady states. These steady states are called \"attractor basins\". <br>As a universal feature of complex adaptive systems, the dynamics of attractors are active in entrepreneurship too. Complexity theory views organizations(or startups, new ventures, etc) as “complex adaptive systems” that coevolve with the environment through the self-organizing behavior of agents navigating “fitness landscapes” (Kauffman, 1995) of market opportunities and competitive dynamics (Coleman, 1999). Such self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Once there, the further dynamics and evolution of the system are likely constrained to remain near the attractor. This also means changing external and internal “attractors” influence the process of adaptation by agents (Coleman, 1999; Stacey, 1996). Since attractors are the most stable and robust elements in these systems, they are more feasible targets for foresight than the several variants that they configure and effectuate (Kuhmonen, 2017). <br><br>The word ‘attractor’ has the connotation that it attracts the system to a certain state. However, it is not a ‘thing’ out there, but an expression of the extent to which a system can change, indicated by its resilience against disturbances (Gerrits, 2012; Marion, 1999). Further, it is a model representation of a system’s behavior. It is not a force of attraction or a goal-oriented presence in the system; it simply depicts where the system is headed based on its rules of motion (Dolan et al, 2000) <br><br>There are 3 major types of attractors (Gerrits, 2012). When a system always returns to exactly the same state when under pressure, it can be expressed by a fixed point attractor (Otter, 2000). A periodic or torus attractor describes the alternation of systems between a limited number of states (Mackenzie, 2005). The third category is highlighted by the inability of a system to return to any of its previous states, in which--each new state is ever so slightly different from the previous one. This category is called the strange attractor (Byrne, 2002). It can remain in this current state because of existing feedback loops that maintain a particular situation. It limits the dynamics of the system but also makes it impossible to predict exactly where the system is going to be. <br><br>The strange attractor is very important in domains like entrepreneurship, business, sociology, etc, because many of the dynamics in these systems behave as if they were guided by these strange attractors. They don't go back to the old state, or jump between states, but are guided by the dynamics of strange attractors. New market opportunities are a good example of attractors. These attractors “pull” entrepreneurs to innovate within existing firms or found new enterprises (Miles et al., 1998). <br><br><br><b>9. Miscellaneous:<br></b><br>Apart from the above 8, the following are also core aspects of complex systems. <br><br><b>Complex systems have a history and history matters;</b> According to Cilliers(2002), Complex systems have a history. Not only do they evolve through time, but their past is co-responsible for their present behavior. This is equivalent to ideas like path dependence (Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995); lock-ins (Arthur, 1989), or Imprinting (Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007), etc. <br><br><b>Complex systems are open systems</b>; They exchange energy or information with their environment—and operate at conditions far from equilibrium. It is also important to note that Self-organization only occurs in such open systems that import energy from the outside (Prigogine and Lefever, 1974). As a result of this, it is often difficult to define the border of a complex system. Further, closed systems are usually merely complicated (Cilliers, 2002). Eg. A venture started in India will be affected by dynamics of US or Chinese markets, Oil price, technology emergence, a crisis like COVID, etc. All these factors are not going to affect the functioning of a complicated system like a PC, car, or machine. <br><br><b>Complex systems evolve in the adjacent possible (Kauffman, 1996)</b>; a zone towards which change and evolution is more likely because of the current disposition of the system. The concept of “adjacent possible” was introduced by Stuart Kauffman(1996; 2000) in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems to explain how biological evolution can be seen as exploration and actualization of what is adjacent possible. It can be defined as “the set of possibilities available to individuals, communities, institutions, organisms, productive processes, etc., at a given point in time during their evolution” (Loreto, 2015). The concept of the “adjacent possible” is useful for understanding how entrepreneurial adjacent possibilities emerge, and how the new adjacent possible will lead to yet newer adjacent possibilities. <br><br><b>Complex adaptive systems like entrepreneurship display power-law distributions</b>; Power laws and outliers are pervasively present across many types of variables that are central to most entrepreneurial activities (Crawford et al, 2015). It is also clear in the success and impact of entrepreneurial ventures. For example, 95% of all U.S. businesses are small--employing 20 people or fewer, and more than 60% of all new jobs are created by a mere .03% of all entrepreneurial start-ups. Further, most successful companies of our time, Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, Walmart, etc, are extreme outliers (Aguinis and Joo, 2015). <br><br><b>Finally, Complex systems may show behaviors</b> like the Mathew-effect(those who begin with advantage accumulate more advantage over time and vice-versa for those who begin with disadvantage), Network-effect( increases in product value with increases in the number of users), Preferential attachment(more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links). For E.g. Initial success improves access to deal flow in venture capital, which leads to accumulated advantage (Nanda,2020). These effects may explain the success of already successful or second-time entrepreneurs, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>3.

Uncertainty can be viewed as part of the real world and it affects individuals at various levels (Folta, 2007; Platt and Huettel, 2008). The role of uncertainty and its various dimensions of it in entrepreneurship is also a widely observed phenomenon (Sarasvathy and Kotha, 2001; Bylund, and McCaffrey, 2017).<br><br><b>* Real-world decisions are affected or constrained by Human Bounded Rationality:&nbsp;</b>In a complex and uncertain world, humans make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Herbert Simon (1957) thus argued that humans have bounded rationality. He suggested that the complexity of the environment and humans’ limited cognitive system make maximization impossible in most real-life decision-making situations. <br><br><b>* Real-world decision contexts thus are mostly based on satisficing logic (Simon, 1947; Brown,2004):</b> We rarely make a decision after possessing all the facts, and as a corollary, In practice, we rarely make a decision based on all the facts in our possession. This is Simon’s (March and Simon, 1958) notion of ‘satisficing’, which refers to the less than optimal choices due to decision makers’ bounded rationality or limited cognitive capacities and lack of time and energy. This involves using of simple rules than complicated models, otherwise known as heuristics (Gigerenzer, 2011). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions are context-dependent (Trueblood et al, 2013; Hutchins and Klausen, 1996).</b> As demonstrated by Herbert Simon's(1990) scissors analogy, real-world decisions must include cognition and context(environment). In other words, we can say, real-world cognition and decision-making are; ecological (Gibson, 1979); embodied, embedded, enactive (Varela et al., 1992), and extended (Clark and Chalmers, 1998) outside of our brain. This means it is essentially impossible to understand(or effect) real-world decisions by cognitive reductionism. <br><br><b>* Real-world decision-making in complex domains can be understood in different ways.</b> Following are 3 of them (Campbell, 1988). Firstly, as a subjective psychological experience. Secondly as an interaction between task and person characteristics (March and Simon, 1958), in that, tasks can be said to be more or less complex relative to the capabilities of the individuals who perform the task. Thirdly, as a function of objective domain or task characteristics(climate change, Entrepreneurship). <br><br><b>* Real-world decision contexts don't have boundaries.&nbsp;</b>Categories like Simple, complicated, complex, chaotic (Snowden and Boone, 2007), even though discussed and studied separately, may appear part of a real-world decision context. This means decision-makers deliberately or intuitively engage in continuous sense-making effort (Kurtz and Snowden, 2003) to identify the decision context they are in. For example, the core aspect of entrepreneurship is complex and uncertain. Even though this is the case, there are complicated jobs to be done like a lawyer's job, accounting, etc. Simple jobs like switching on the lights, cleaning the floor, etc. <br><br><b>* Real-world decision-makers use ambidextrous methods.</b>&nbsp;Entrepreneurs use both causal and effectual approaches in a variety of combinations. Both causation and effectuation are integral parts of human reasoning that can occur simultaneously, overlapping and intertwining over different contexts of decisions and actions (Sarasvathy, 2009). According to Yang and Gabrielsson(2017), entrepreneurs use ambidexterity in methods. i.e. the capability to employ both exploration and exploitation methods, or simultaneously use the effectual process to explore and create a new market, and the causal process to exploit the existing market. Further, <br><br><b>* Real-world problems don’t care about disciplinary boundaries(Bendix, 2020).</b> This asserts that interdisciplinary working is needed in order to explore the ‘real world’ problems (Dalrymple and Miller, 2006). This awareness may help the decision-maker to expand the search space. Real-world entrepreneurship is contextual and according to Welter’s (2011), \"a contextualized view on entrepreneurship asks for an interdisciplinary perspective, as the solution cannot be to develop an overarching theory of entrepreneurship in all contexts, but rather working with disciplines like anthropology, sociology, and others, which possess some of the tools and concepts entrepreneurship scholars need to explore the variety, depths, and richness of contexts”. Scholars have also acknowledged this importance in entrepreneurship education (Penaluna and Penaluna, 2009; Janssen et al, 2007) <br><br><b>* Real-world predictions about the future cannot be accurate even with all the knowledge about the past.</b> Out past and history is important because of the path dependence, but it can only suggest insights about the current disposition, not an accurate future state. This can be explained by the butterfly effect which occurs when a very small change in one part of a complex adaptive system may initially go unrecognized results in a massive disruption, surprise, or turbulence. The results may be impossible to predict (Bennet and Bennet, 2008). This is because we can't get the accurate and massive amount of necessary data in its dynamics. This can also be seen as an implication of unavoidable uncertainty in the initial condition (Boffetta et al, 2002). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may involve trade-offs between exploit(efficiency) and explore(evolvability).</b>&nbsp;Many decisions in the lives of animals and humans require a fine balance between the exploration of different options and the exploitation of their rewards (Mehlhorn et al, 2015). Exploitation maximizes rewards in the near term, while the information obtained during the exploration can later be used to maximize rewards in the long term (Barack and Gold, 2016). Too much exploitation could promote rigidity and optimization in a local niche, and too much exploration may result in becoming a situation like \"a jack of all trades, but master of none\". Here also the concept of satisficing is important. <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may have unintended-consequence (Merton, 1936)</b>, particularly in domains of many interacting agents. E.g. The Hawthorne effect (Sedgwick and Greenwood, 2015; Wickström and Bendix, 2000), Cobra Effect (Warczak Jr, 2020), etc. The unintended consequences are the result of complexity, and the inability of decision-makers to understand and anticipate the emergent realities. <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may directly affect other people in the network.</b> Further, people in one's network affect his/her decision making and are in turn affected by decisions of other agents (Christakis and Fowler, 2007; Edelenbos and Klijn, 2007; Sadovykh et al, 2015; Ingold and Leifeld, 2016).<br><br><b>* Real-world complex contexts may not have clear measures of performance or success.</b> It may be absent, conflicting, or vague. Who can say person x made the better fatherly decision for his child than person y. It is totally relative. Even the output, i.e. the child's success may or may not have anything to do with the parenting decision in a long run. This is not to say that there is no measurable performance in the real world; there are. In domains where performance can be objectively measured, such measures drive success, but when performance can’t be measured, it is possible that networks, people or society drive success\" (Barabási, 2018). Success is thus a collective endeavor, independent from individual performance. Besides performance, success requires building trust and reputation in order to shape others’ perceptions regarding one’s achievements (Day, 2019). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions are not just individual driven but distributed (Rapley, 2008; Schneeweiss,2012).</b>&nbsp;Decision making in the real world is distributed across various stakeholders(eg. Investors, co-founders, family), institutions(government agencies, partner companies), artifacts(software, notebook, Mobile), etc. A real-world example is patient and doctor decision making, in which both patient and doctor have a legitimate investment in the treatment decision; hence both declare treatment preferences, the rationale for such preference, etc while trying to build consensus on the appropriate treatment to apply (Charles et al, 1997, 1999). In real-world contexts like entrepreneurship, there are multiple stakeholders with diverse and conflicting beliefs, preferences, and goals. This idea is enacted in the \"Crazy Quilt Principle\" of effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2009), where partnerships determine, to a great extent, which product or market the company will eventually end up entering or creating. <br><br><b>* Real-world decision problems are interactive and dynamic.</b>&nbsp;In a complex domain, decision-makers(entrepreneurs or managers) are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. These problems are labeled by Ackoff as messes (Ackoff 1978; Bennet et al, 2008). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions involve an active role for emotions (Hermalin and Isen, 2008).</b> Emotion is an intrinsic part of human decision-making in the real-world context. Research reveals that emotions constitute potent, pervasive, predictable, sometimes harmful, and sometimes beneficial drivers of decision making(Lerner et al. 2015). Many scholars now view emotions as one of the dominant drivers of most meaningful decisions in life. This is well observed in entrepreneurship also (Foo, 2011; Cardon et al, 2005; Arpiainen et al, 2013). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions are path-dependent (Koch et al, 2009; Bindler and Hjalmarsson, 2019).</b> Path dependence means that where we go next depends not only on where we are now but also upon where we have been; Thus, \"History Matters\" (Liebowitz and Margolis, 1999). Our decisions of the past and present will influence the future decision landscape, opening up some choices, and constraining others. In the same way, It is also influenced and framed by the path-dependence of other agents. <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions and success are influenced by timing.</b> The right timing is one of the most important aspects of decision making in complexity and it is true in the entrepreneurship context too (Wadhwani et al, 2020). According to Bill Gross(2008), the single biggest reason why startups succeed is timing. Since complex domains exhibit dynamics of interaction and evolution (&amp; co-evolution) the opportunity structure changes all the time. We must act when the evolutionary potential of other systems around us is primed perfectly for a change. For E.g. Facebook was started when a basic infrastructure was already evolved enough to support it, like the internet, connectivity(user base), previous models that showed the way(Orkut, myspace, etc.). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may be impulsive.</b> Most human decisions in everyday life are not based on elaborate planning and research. Even in the case of important life decisions, people may rely more on emotions and impulsiveness. Simple heuristics are the most preferred decision-making device human beings use, and they mostly work (Gigerenzer, 2008). Studies have also shown that a significant part of entrepreneurial behaviors may also occur without ex-ante reasoning (Wiklund, 2019). According to Lerner et al(2018), non-deliberative impulse-driven behavioral logics can also be the basis for business venturing. <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may be based on intuition.&nbsp;</b>Researchers have discovered and acknowledged that decision-makers in real-world decision contexts rely heavily on intuition (e.g., Klein, 2015; Gigerenzer and Murray, 2015; Kruglanski and Gigerenzer, 2011). Further, according to William Duggan(2013), decision-makers may also use different types of intuition, namely; ordinary(every day), expert(fast judgment based on experience and practice), and strategic(a flash of insight that works in new situations). <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions are based on selective perception and use of information (Dearborn and Simon, 1958; Walsh, 1988; Beyer et al, 1997).&nbsp;</b>There is always far more information in our objective environments than we can perceive or attend to. Thus, perceptions must be strongly guided by anticipations. As March and Simon (1958) noted, under conditions of complexity and imperfect information, decisions are made on the basis of selective perception and identification with sub-goals. <br><br><b>* Real-world decisions may have heterogeneous reasons.</b>&nbsp;Bringing all of it together, it is absolutely clear that real-world decisions are massively complex and it can have a lot of different dimensions. This makes it difficult to pinpoint specific causes because you can only see the dimensions that you are looking at. Thus it can be, cognitive biases (Stanovich &amp; West, 2008), past experience (Juliusson et al, 2005), escalation of commitment (Sleesman et al, 2012), age and individual differences (Bruin et al, 2007), belief in personal relevance (Acevedo, &amp; Krueger, 2004), etc. To conclude, an economics model-driven view of decisions historically assumed the existence of a straightforward, linear thinking, rational decision-maker (Brzezicka and Wiśniewski, 2014). But in real-world complex contexts, decisions are often not what they appear to be. A decision presented as a technical decision may in fact be tactical, political and strategic, or egocentric, emotional and personal, or any or all of them, or more.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 3\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>4. Implication of complexity in the development of expertise \n</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"sign mbr-iconfont mbri-arrow-down\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse4\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\">In the previous chapters, I have demonstrated why entrepreneurship is a complex decision domain by examining some of the features of entrepreneurial complexity. This chapter is about the expertise dimension of complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Expertise under complexity </b><br><br><b>First of all,</b> any effort to understand expertise in a complex domain is by itself complex. Every single issue in question may include a heterogeneous mix of problems and domains(e.g. simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic parts, and Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Economics, Psychology, etc.), all of which require different frame-sets for understanding. <br><br><b>Secondly,</b> According to Kahnemann &amp; Klein(2009), two conditions must be satisfied for a judgment to be recognized as coming from real expertise(expert intuition); First, the environment must provide adequately valid cues to the nature of the situation. The second one is that people must have an opportunity to learn the relevant cues. The determination of whether intuitive judgments can be trusted thus requires an examination of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the opportunity that the judge has had to learn the regularities of that environment. A crucial conclusion is that skilled intuitions will only develop in an environment of sufficient regularity, which provides valid cues to the situation. Thus, If an environment provides valid cues, prolonged practice opportunity with rapid and unequivocal feedback,---skill and expert intuition will eventually develop in individuals of sufficient talent. Such an environment also helps true experts develop skills to know when they don’t know something, something which non-experts certainly do not know (Kruger and Dunning, 1999).  Other scholars (before Kahnemann &amp; Klein, 2009) have also tried to bring out this case. For example, James Shanteau(1992) used the classification of Type 1 Type 2 domains to analyze the complexity and learnability of various environments. Hogarth's(2015) concept of the kind and wicked learning environments is another model representing a similar idea. He described wicked as situations in which feedback in the form of outcomes of actions or observations is poor, misleading, or even missing. By contrast, in learning environments that are kind, feedback links outcomes directly to the appropriate actions or judgments and is both accurate and plentiful. <br><br><b>Thirdly,</b> deliberate practice may not work in a complex domain. Saraswathy(2009) defines an expert as someone who has attained a high level of performance in the domain as a result of years of experience and deliberate practice (Ericsson et al., 1993). But in recent scholarly works, it has been observed that deliberate practice may not guarantee better performance in extremely complex domains. A 2014 meta-analysis (Macnamara et al, 2014) has shown that deliberate practice only explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. This further demonstrates a low connection between deliberate practice and performance in complex unstructured domains. <br><br><b>Fourthly,</b> expertise in complex social domains is distributed (Edwards, 2010). It is not necessary that a person must be an expert in finance, accounting, programming, law, etc. Such expertise is distributed(and or extended) across various individuals(lawyer, doctor) institutions(law enforcement, companies) and artifacts(tools, software). etc. It is not even necessary that a person know the core activities when it comes to social domains. He can still win in-case he is in the right high network place, get good people to mentor and work, get access to specialized institutions, have a rich family to support, etc. He can also fail despite all of this.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Fifthly,</b> complex social domains are subjected to various complexity laws like power laws, Mathew effects, reputation effects, ecosystem-embedded-preferential-attachment, etc. This invalidates success as a metric of expertise. Core events in complex systems never repeats in originality(strange attractor effect), feedback is delayed, and since complex systems are governed by power laws, small things can result in huge success, and resource rich interventions can fail. A tangent is that the emergent property of a system may not be the result of the expertise of a particular agent or agents, but because of the dynamics of the whole system co-evolving with the ecosystem as a whole. This may prevent us from establishing any valid causal relationship between expertise and performance in a domains of complexity. Thus in complexity, high performance may not guarantee success, in that, the success of an individual does not depend uniquely on the quality of performance (Barabási, 2018). <br><br><b>Sixthly,</b> If anyone becomes successful in such a system, she(he) acquires what I call ecosystem embedded accumulated advantage(e.g. PayPal mafia), a Mathew effect which makes it easy for the agent to be successful in any substituent pursuits. This makes it difficult to identify the causation behind any success. That also makes it difficult to compare an expert with non expert by looking at performance as Barabási (2018) pointed out.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Finally,</b> all of the above issues lead to the idea of \"Complex indeterminate causation” (Hoffman et al., 2011) which represents a situation in which rational individual decision-making is hindered by an inability to discern a clear chain of causality. “In real-world settings, the evidence for causation is typically too ambiguous to permit valid reasoning.” (Hoffman et al., 2011, p. 419).&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 4\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">\n                                   <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>5. Problems with current dominant entrepreneurship models \n</b></h6>\n                                        <span class=\"mbr-iconfont mobi-mbri-arrow-down mobi-mbri\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\">Adjoined with the technology entrepreneurship boom and the glamorization of entrepreneurship as an ideal career choice, there has been a growing interest among various actors in the entrepreneurial ecosystem to provide/get valid guidance in entrepreneurial action. This is also because many have grown increasingly skeptical of the usefulness of traditional methods like business plans. Both scholars and practitioners have responded to this demand by suggesting a variety of heuristics (Manimala, 1992) and prescriptive models (Mansoori, 2017). <br><br>Entrepreneurial heuristics includes thumb rules guiding the decisions involved in the start-up and management of a new venture. E.g. Product-market fit, Do Things that Don't Scale, 1000 true fans(or 100), Mom Test, Jobs to be done, etc. <br><br>Prescriptive methods or models are principles of thought and action that guide the theoretical and practical aspects of human action (Mansoori 2017). Some examples are; Business Planning (Sahlman, 1997, Delmar and Shane, 2003), Contingency planning (Honig, 2004, Marc Gruber 2017), Discovery-driven planning (McGrath and MacMillan, 1995), Probe-and-Learn approach (Lynn et al., 1996), Lean start-up approach (Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011), Theory-Based View (Felin et al, 2020), Disciplined Entrepreneurship (Sull, 2004), Design thinking (Brown, 2008; Plattner, 2013), Effectual entrepreneurship (Sarasvathy, 2001), etc. <br><br><b>Weakness of existing prescriptive models. <br></b><br>Prescriptive methods of entrepreneurship have been criticized for their lack of rigor and relevance by various scholars (Garbuio et al., 2018; Frank and Landström 2016, Arend et al. 2015, Wolf and Rosenberg 2012; Yordanova, 2022; York and Danes, 2014). Scholars have also shown that entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and why it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science. This is a major challenge because complex systems are affected by the emergent property, evolutionary dynamics, non-linearity, etc. In complex systems like entrepreneurship past behavior may not predict its future behavior. A small change in any of the initial condition variables can result in a huge difference in the end result. <br><br>I argue that most prescriptive models are reductionist in origin and most are ignoring (or ignorant) of complexity by omission or prescription. Most of the models listed above are originated or validated by using traditional linear scientific methods, transforming the results into prescriptive insights for entrepreneurs, suggesting how should they act. Further, it has been found that regression analysis is rated as the most fundamental method in entrepreneurship research scholars should be familiar with, but is inappropriate for studying complex systems (Berger and Kuckertz, 2016). This is especially important when scholars have exposed various types of complexity-effects that cannot be understood by traditional methods. For e.g. Crawford et al(2015) have identified complexity effects in entrepreneurship in the form of power laws, suggesting the use of complexity informed methods. <br><br>Another source is anecdotal and idiosyncratic experiences of ecosystem actors like entrepreneurs or institutions like VCs or accelerators. A widely used example that fits the category is the lean startup (Ries 2011), which is often criticized for its explicit demonstration of survivorship bias, which is a bias of focusing on a successful sample and claiming it to be representative of the entire group (Snowden, 2019). <br><br><b>Following are some of the significant weaknesses of existing methods/models when considering the nature of entrepreneurial complexity. <br></b><br><b>1. Ignoring context<br></b><br>Entrepreneurship is still a highly decontextualized research field, which is also reflected in the popular prescriptive models we use, and also one-size-fits-all advice received to entrepreneurs. Most of the dominant perspectives still assume that entrepreneurship is the same all over the world, regardless of historical, cultural, institutional, social, and spatial contexts. This is clear from the growing homogeneity in mentorship, accelerator, and entrepreneurship education programs. This has been described as a McDonaldization of entrepreneurship education (Hytti, 2018), a highly standardized menu of activities is served up for student consumption, such as competitions and mini-company creation. According to Baker and Welter(2018), the messiness and complexity of entrepreneurship derive from contextual questions like; Who is driving it?; A community? A family? An individual?. What are the different types of social networks invoked?; friends, family, community, various stakeholders, etc. These are embedded within, and in turn, affect regulatory, and normative contexts at the community, regional, national, and broader levels. Thus entrepreneurship can only be understood within its historical, temporal, institutional, spatial, and social contexts, as these contexts provide individuals with opportunities and set boundaries for their actions. Most prescriptive models promote a model-centric view of the world and are not flexible or intelligent enough to capture crucial contextual insights.<br><br><b>2. Lacks Evolvability<br></b><br>This is a truism. Evolution is a fundamental feature of nature, biology, and human social life. In comparison to biological evolution, the human social system is capable of adapting to change at a faster rate. It is particularly significant in the case of entrepreneurship in that entrepreneurs often act as catalysts of social evolution and also are affected by the smallest of changes in the environment. One of the major sources of weakness in existing entrepreneurship models is the lack of evolvability. Once proposed and written down the model never changes. There is very little scope for contextualization. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in the entrepreneurship domain are self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it gives a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity.<br><br><b>3. Fixation Errors and Design Fixation<br></b><br>According to De Keyser and Woods (1990), many critical real-world human problem-solving situations take place in dynamic event-driven environments, where the evidence comes over time and situations can change rapidly. In these situations, people must amass and integrate, uncertain, incomplete, and changing evidence. A major source of human error in dynamic domains seems to be a failure to revise situation assessment as new evidence comes in. I argue that most of the commonly suggested methods like a business plan and lean-startup are highly vulnerable to what Keyser and Woods call Fixation errors. Prescriptive models are especially vulnerable to another type of fixation called design fixation (Jansson and Smith,1991), which refers to the designer’s inability to consider multiple strategies to formulate and solve a design need. It is the direct result of knowledge representation, with human knowledge argued to be organized categorically. These categories are defined by prototypes that exemplify the category (Condoor &amp; LaVoie, 2007). Since linear approaches like Lean startup and business model canvas etc. are based on structured and step-by-step processes, they may add to the rigidity and hence may act as counterproductive in dynamic high-stress environments. This rigidity may lead to design fixation (Garbuio et al., 2018).<br><br><b>4. GRE'isation  of entrepreneurship<br></b><br>Eric Ries(2011) introduced the concept of Actionable metric and Vanity metric by taking the example of a test preparation company called Grockit. This made me think about the formidable role Lean-startup played in the matricization of entrepreneurship culture.  According to Eric Ries, “When cause and effect is clearly understood, people are better able to learn from their actions. Human beings are innately talented learners when given a clear and objective assessment”.  As a combo, the lean-startup has introduced many other concepts like Validated learning, Innovation accounting, etc as part of their metricization drive. Because of this, I thought it is more than appropriate to call the role played by the lean-startup in bringing measurement culture to the entrepreneurship domain as the “GRE’isation of entrepreneurship”.<br><br>The problem here is the complete ignorance of the complexity of the real world. In complex domains, you can't have the perfect objective answer or action. There is not even an objective goal. Everything is dynamic and co-evolving.  Secondly, In a complex domain like entrepreneurship, emergent property is a key feature. For example, the idea you initially had can emerge into a radically new formation, an emergent property that you could have never imagined before. For E.g. Instagram was started as an HTML5 supported location-based service; Facebook was started as an app to compare two people’s pictures and the rate which one was more attractive.  When you introduce a metric to a radically changing, complex, dynamic, and emergent system like a startup, it will amount to the manifestation of Goodhart's Law that suggests that \"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\" (Strathern, 1997; Manheim and Scott, 2018). When we set one specific goal, people will tend to optimize for that objective regardless of the context and consequences. It is extremely troublesome if the metric is introduced as a target in a domain that is dynamic and emergent like that in entrepreneurship.  Here the measurement based on metric itself is not a problem, but the effect of such metric fixation(Muller, 2021) will stagnate the startup and uncouple the venture from ecological realities and opportunities. <br>&nbsp;<br><b> 5. The Know it all and Goal-directed visionary entrepreneur.<br></b><br>Most of the prescriptive models are driven by the idea of objective goal-driven entrepreneurs who know the particular direction they want to take. Saras Saraswathy articulates such goal-directed behavior as causation. According to her, “Causation processes take a particular effect (a goal, direction or action) as given and focus on selecting between means to create that effect”(Sarasvathy, 2001, p.245).  The causal goal-driven nature of Lean-startup and customer development was also attested by Steve Blank. According to him, he invented the Customer Development process trying to solve two startup problems. \"First, most Silicon Valley startups were (and primarily still are) technology-driven. They are founded and funded by visionaries who already have products (or product ideas based on technology innovation) and now need to find customers and markets. (Think of the early days of Intel, Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). Second, burn rate and dwindling cash meant startups had to find these customers and the attendant product/market fit rapidly – before they ran out of money\" (Blank,  2014).  <br><br>First of all, as a descriptive account, none of the example companies he listed, like Intel, Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, were the product of visionary goal-driven linear action. There is no evidence of it, and the stories of these companies paint a different picture----a picture of unforeseen direction change, growth and opportunities. This was not the case of an algorithmic pivot, but a nonlinear emergence that is dependent on contextual intelligence. It was further demonstrated by the works of Saras Sarasvathy(2001), in which she revealed how entrepreneurs prefer effectual logic over causal logic. Effectuation processes take a set of means as given and focus on selecting between possible effects that can be created with that set of means. Greg Fisher in his comparative study of effectuation, causation, and bricolage(Fisher, 2012) has shown that there were no cases where only the behaviors associated with causation were responsible for the development of the venture. Studies have also ascertained that a substantial part of entrepreneurial behaviors occurs without ex-ante reasoning (Wiklund, 2019). According to Lerner et al(2018), non-deliberative impulse-driven behavioral logics can also be the basis for business venturing.<br><br>Secondly, in a prescriptive sense, a know-it-all goal-driven visionary, who wants to implement his ideas as efficiently as possible is troublesome. It reduces exploration. It can negatively affect openness to emergent serendipitous opportunities. Further, according to Penaluna and Penaluna(2021), clear goals and definitions may hinder opportunities to develop divergent thinking that takes account of multiple perspectives and alternative views. The ‘rush’ to answers may lead to premature articulation, with a basic iterative solution or first idea taking priority over the potential range of alternatives. <br><br><b>6. Possessive individualism<br></b><br>Most prescriptive models are based on the idea of the sole entrepreneur making decisions. This relates to the idea of Possessive individualism, which is the assumption that capacities, beliefs, and desires, etc. are possessions of an individual (Macpherson, 2010). In this approach, the individual is viewed atomistically as ‘essentially the proprietor of his own person or capacities; which include: intelligence; cognitive capacities such as memory; the ability to process information; and such personality characteristics as desires and wants, crucially ‘owing nothing to society for them’(MacPherson, 1962, p. 3). The reality is far from the case. According to  Clark and Chalmers(1998), real-world cognition and decisions are extended outside of our brain. They present the idea of active externalism in which objects within the environment function as a part of the mind. They argue that the separation between the mind, the body, and the environment is an unprincipled distinction. This suggests that entrepreneurial cognition and decisions are not simply happening inside the entrepreneur's brain, but extended outside.&nbsp;<br><br>Another way to view it is the distributed nature of real-world decisions(Rapley, 2008; Schneeweiss,2012; Charles et al, 1997, 1999). In contexts like entrepreneurship, there are multiple stakeholders with diverse and conflicting beliefs, preferences, and goals. They all are part of entrepreneurial cognition and decisions. This distributed nature of decisions in entrepreneurship is partially influenced by the distributed nature of expertise in complex social domains (Edwards, 2010). It is not necessary that an entrepreneur must be an expert in finance, accounting, programming, law, etc. Such expertise is distributed(and or extended) across various individuals(lawyer, doctor) institutions(law enforcement, companies), artifacts(tools, software), etc. It is not even necessary that the entrepreneur know the entrepreneurial core activities. He/She can still win in-case he/she is in the right high network place, get good people to mentor and work, get access to specialized institutions, have a rich family to support, etc. Further, In a complex domain, decision-makers(entrepreneurs or managers) are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. These problems are labeled by Ackoff as messes (Ackoff 1978; Bennet et al, 2008).<br><br><b>7. Structure and Issue of Agency<br></b><br>Agency is described as an individual’s ability at any given point in time, to act independently in order to change the internal or external environment (Bandura, 2001; Campbell, 2009; Hitlin &amp; Elder, 2007). Scholars have long observed that the structure of society that includes other agents and artifacts will have influence over the individual agency. Thus it can be observed that once designed and introduced into the interactional scene by humans,----texts, artifacts, and objects of any kind make sense and have an agency on their own (Caronia and Mortari, 2015; Bruno Latour, 1996). I argue that most of the popular prescriptive models have agency of their own, and most of them are designed to highjack entrepreneurial agency by providing a model-centric view of the world. This can result in developing commitment to one-size-fits-all models that may result in the agent's evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential being seriously compromised. Further, In the descriptive sense, most of the prescriptive models assume that entrepreneurs possess excessive powers of agency (Kitching and Rouse, J.2020). This is evident from the inherent assumption that regular entrepreneurs are using exactly what the model prescribes, almost like an algorithmic precision. In the practical sense, the models take control of the entrepreneur's agency by prescribing things to do and think. It is suggestive of what to see, what to do, what not to do, etc.<br><br><b>8. Local optima, Bounded rationality, and Local search</b><br><br>Research has found that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does to established firms and that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice (Simon, 1955) prematurely across many decisions (Cohen et al 2019). Most of the prescriptive models assume(by omission or prescription) that the entrepreneurs are able to review all information and make a rational decision in their best interest. Research on human bounded rationality suggests these assumptions are wrong. Another dimension of this issue is that entrepreneurs generally start their venture with a preference to ‘local search’, whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge. This leads to the identification of local optima rather than global optima (Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996; Keinz &amp; Prügl, 2010; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001). An empirical study done by Shane(2000) has also shown that entrepreneurs tend to identify opportunities that were either already known to them in the past or are closely related to their existing stock of knowledge. This phenomenon is also known as local search bias (Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001). The local search behavior is of inevitable importance but the problem is that focusing on existing knowledge and expertise alone can Impede the entrepreneur from exploring distant solutions. I argue that most of the existing entrepreneurship models reinforce and augment bounded rationality and local search behavior. They are optimized for local search behavior in which they may make entrepreneurs more susceptible to being blinded by their own bounded rationality. For a design to be sustainable it must acknowledge that the end-users are fallible humans with bounded rationality. It must take into account cognitive limitations, bias, and dispositions. Models must anticipate the potential issues that could arise from bounded rationality and compensate for them with built-in design solutions.<br><br><b>9. In exclusion of others by omission or prescription.<br></b><br>In complexity and evolution, heterogeneity is an asset. The more the relevant elements of variation present(requisite variety) in a system, the more resilient and evolvable a system will become. Despite that, most models are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one. It is often pitched as better than the previous one. E.g. Plan Vs Lean startup. Using the antecedent as a frame to marginally improve the model is also the standard practice. While this is the reality, studies have shown that real entrepreneurs don't behave according to the dictum of any prescriptive models. Fisher(2012) for example investigated behavior underlying the venture founding process using effectuation, bricolage, and causation has found that entrepreneurs often use elements of all the 3 theoretical models and that there were no cases in which only the behaviors associated with causation were responsible for the development of the venture. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) in their analysis stressed the possibility of using multiple methods complementing each other, which is a standard practice in weather prediction(ensemble models). Sarasvathy (2001) also asserted the point that both causation and effectuation are integral parts of human reasoning that can occur simultaneously, overlapping and intertwining over different contexts of decisions and actions” (p. 245). This shows that real-world decisions in a complex adaptive system cannot be understood with linear thinking or binaries. Since it is impossible to know various emergent decision contexts beforehand, it is always ideal to design solutions for such variables and contingencies. That means not excluding ideas, models and theories, etc by prescription or omission.<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 5\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>6.

It must also consider the disposition and bounded rationality of the decision-making agent in question. Following my analysis of entrepreneurial complexity and weakness of contemporary thinking, I propose the incorporation of some important dispositional capabilities necessary for a sustainable model for entrepreneurial action. <br><br>They; <br><br><b>*Must begin with the right view: </b>The right worldview (Dent, 1999) is a necessary precondition to effective design. If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. <br><br><b>*Must acknowledge and promote self-organization:</b> Self-organization (Heylighen, 2008) refers to the feature of systems that appear to organize themselves without external direction, manipulation, or control. This promotes ecologically grounded evolution and dynamics. A sustainable, complexity-friendly model must promote self-organization instead of one-size-fits-all models, rigid prescriptions, or top-down order. <br><br><b>*Must promote exploration:</b> While self-organization may promote local optimization, the dispositional capability for exploration (Gupta et al, 2006) is necessary to facilitate the journey towards global optima. A sustainable complexity friendly model must have the capability for continuous multidimensional exploration. <br><br><b>*Must promote diversity (Page, 2010) integration (Martin, 2009), and inclusiveness (Pless and Maak, 2004):</b> Decisions in a complex domain like entrepreneurship cannot be understood with linear thinking or binaries. Since it is impossible to know various emergent decision contexts beforehand, it is always ideal to design solutions for such variables and contingencies. That means a design must promote diversity and not exclude ideas, models, theories, etc., by prescription or omission. <br><br><b>*Must be contextually adaptive: </b>Every context is unique, and thus we need solutions that are adaptable and usable for various contexts, as it emerges. Adaptive systems involve designing the elements of a system to find by themselves the solution of the problem. Like this, when the problem changes, the elements are able to dynamically find a new solution. We can say that such a system self-organizes (Gershenson, 2007). <br><br><b>*Must provide evolvability to the agent and must have evolvability of its own: </b>Evolution and evolvability (Pigliucci, 2008; ScienceDaily, 2013) are a fundamental feature of nature, biology, and human social life. A sustainable entrepreneurship framework must have the evolutionary potential of its own, and also must enable evolvability to the entrepreneurial agents. <br><br><b>*Must protect agency from hijack:</b> Prescriptive models have agency of their own, and are designed to hijack entrepreneurial agency by providing a model-centric view of the world. Commitment to one-size-fits-all models may result in the agent's evolutionary, learning, adaptive potential being seriously compromised. Thus, a sustainable complexity-friendly model must protect and promote appropriate levels of entrepreneurial agency (Garud and Karnøe, 2003) and autonomy. <br><br><b>*Must acknowledge the dispositional state, including ignorance and weaknesses:</b> Most of the existing entrepreneurship models reinforce and augment bounded rationality. A sustainable complexity-friendly model must acknowledge the possibility for bounded rationality, ignorance, and weaknesses. It must have inbuilt dispositional capabilities like distributed sense-making (Weick, 2005; Fisher, 2012) and descriptive self-awareness (Snowden, 2002), etc. to continually scan inwards and outwards for issues like ignorance, weakness, or bounded rationality. <br><br><b>*Must encapsulate various complexity-friendly functional dispositions:</b> A complexity-friendly model must also be designed with a usability perspective in mind. It must encapsulate various complexity-friendly functional dispositions(above listed) into a single framework so that an ecology of ideas, in its dynamics, will transfer to the users, not just one or two ideas. <br><br><b>*Must strive forward as a continuous work in progress in a perpetual construction (Prigogine, 1997):</b> Once proposed and written down, most models or prescriptive methods never change. This is a weakness when considering the speed of radical changes happening around us. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in the entrepreneurship domain are designed to be self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. A sustainable complexity friendly model must have the capability to change itself according to challenges. <br><b><br>In the following part, I will demonstrate the design of this framework as a complexity-based design framework to aid entrepreneurial action.

If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. As discussed previously, entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science (McKelvey, 2004). Despite this reality, most entrepreneurship models and perspectives are reductionist in their origin, prescription, or omission. To solve this weakness this framework adopts an ecological world view, i.e a complex, dynamic, connected, and evolving ecology. <br><br>In order to understand the ecological view, let's first go through some of the existing world views or alternatives. After that, I will introduce the ecological view to show how it is different from other world views. <br><br><b>1. Single Model world view:</b> This is the world view based on a single model, tool, or method which assumes superiority over all others. This can be equated to what Charlie Munger(1994)calls, “Man with a Hammer” syndrome, which is the idea that if an individual has only one tool or model(e.g. hammer), he'll approach all of his problems with the same solution, i.e. a hammer. For a man with a hammer, everything around him will seem like a nail. Most models in entrepreneurship come under this category. They are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one and are pitched as better than the previous one. E.g. Lean startup (Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011) Vs Business planning, Theory-based view (Felin et al, 2020) vs Lean, etc. Using the antecedent as a frame to marginally improve the model is also the standard practice. <br><br><b>2. Multiple-Model Ensembles: </b>This world view suggests the complementary use of multiple models or methods. This is the same idea as suggested by Scott Page(2018) and the ensemble forecasting model (Leutbecher and Palmer, 2008) used in weather prediction. In entrepreneurship, multiple model world view can be found in many scholarly works. For e.g. Sarasvathy(2001)stressed the importance of both effectuation and causation. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) suggested using multiple methods complementing each other. This world view is by default inclusive of the previous one. <br><br><b>3. Cognitive-Diversity world view:</b> This world view suggests using not only formal models or methods but all kinds of cognitive diversity. E.g. Models, methods, theories, heuristics, etc. Scott Page defines Cognitive Diversity as “Differences in information, knowledge, representations, mental models, and heuristic, to better outcomes on specific tasks such as problem-solving, predicting, and innovating (Page, 2017,14-15)\". To me, the weakness of this view is in its cognitive reductionism. Even though this world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones, any cognitive alone worldview can be criticized for lack of ecological basis (Gibson, 1979; Varela et al., 1991; Clark, 1997). <br><br><br><b>4. Holistic Diversity worldview:</b> Apart from cognitive diversity, Page(2017) also talks about identity diversity, i.e. the differences in race, gender, age, physical capabilities, and sexual orientation. There are other frames to view diversities like; Biodiversity, which can be defined as variety in all forms of life—from genes to species to ecosystems (Wood, 1997); Cultural diversity, which can be defined as differences, such as in language, religion, dress and moral codes that exist between people according to race and ethnicity (Leveson et al, 2009; Kossek and Zonia, 1993). Tool diversity suggesting for the use of multiple tools for the same task to increase output accuracy by reducing systematic errors (Song et al, 2018). Artifact diversity refers to the number of different classes of artifacts and their relative proportions (Lyman and O'Brien, 2000). In short, this world view suggests the existence of not only Cognitive-Diversity but also, all other kinds of diversity, i.e. diversity in people, biology, identity, networks, information sources, relational-expertise, institutions, culture, location, specialization, artifacts, tools, etc. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. <br><br><br><b>5. Ecological View or Deep ecology view:</b> This includes a continuous effort to capture the true ecological reality in its dynamics. In addition to the previously listed holistic diversity, this view is inclusive of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, interaction, etc. Complexity involves features and interactive dynamics as in a complex adaptive system. The idea of evolution suggests that existing elements interact, evolve, co-evolve into new diversities, variations, etc. It must also involve cumulative cultural evolution(and intelligence) as proposed by human cultural evolution studies. In addition, an ecology is connected, hence no clear local-global separation is possible. This is particularly significant in human social ecology. Finally, the ecological view involves the use of contextualized sense-making that suggests that every human context is an emergent property and hence each context has unique types of characters. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. <br><br><br><b>The framework's worldview: 3 parts <br></b><br><b>1. Deep ecology (Arne Naess, 1973; Capra, 1996) <br></b><br>A practical or working definition of ecology can change with the unit of observation, domains or problems, etc. Thus, ecology can be defined in a biological perspective as the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment, while for e.g. if we are looking at the disease ecology, it can be defined as the ecological study of host-pathogen interactions within the context of their environment and evolution (Kilpatrick and Altizer, 2010). Similarly, the term social ecology in the context of child health and well-being would mean a nested arrangement of family, school, neighborhood, and community contexts in which children grow up (Earls and Carlson, 2001). Likewise, information ecology may mean the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment (Pekkarinen et al, 2020). Further, ecology can also be of a subdomain(problem or topic), like for e.g. the phenomena of human suffering which comes under mental health. Thus, “ecology” can refer to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him or her (Jadhav, 2015). <br><br>With this practical understanding, this framework operates in the entrepreneurial ecology, where multiple agents, institutions, artifacts, problems, etc, interact with each other to form a complex adaptive interdependent system that emerges in the human socio-cognitive-material space. Even though the framework(and by implication the users of the framework) operates primarily in the entrepreneurial ecology, the world view it beholds is \"deep ecology\". This means, entrepreneurial ecology is part of deep ecology and everything is connected to everything else. <br><br>The philosophical school of deep ecology was founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess(1973). He developed the concept by distinguishing it with what he calls shallow ecology, which is human-centered. Shallow ecology \"views humans as above or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental, or \"use,\" value to nature. Deep ecology does not separate humans--or anything else-from the natural environment. It sees the world not as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic value of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life\"(Capra, 1996). <br><br>According to Capra(1996, p.3), the ecological worldview grew out of an awareness that contemporary problems cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are interconnected and interdependent. He uses the term ‘deep ecology’ to highlight the inescapable connections and mutual influences among the human, natural, physical, and constructed environments implicit in this view of reality (Mitchell and Sackney, 2011, p.2). Further, the deep ecological perspective can be viewed as a perspective to ecological complexity that involves properties like holistic interconnection, interdependence, heterogeneous agents, non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, emergent property, self-organization, dynamics of evolution, attractor behavior, power Laws, open exchange or energy and information with their environment, etc. <br><br><br><b>2. Self Organization <br></b><br>The second important part of this worldview is Self-organisation. This is about seeing entrepreneurs, industries, economies, etc as self-organizing systems. As discussed in part 1, It refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level (Kauffman, 1995; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. In self-organization, the final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and micro design, and it cannot be known beforehand.  <br><br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(1) where I will introduce the theory of effectual self-organization <br><br><b>3. Constraints <br></b><br>Self-organization happens under various constraints. Constraints in a general sense may be taken as restrictive. But it is important to understand that constraints are enabling too. Order in human life is primarily created through constraints. \"It is not something which merely limits possibilities, constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced” (Cilliers, 2001). <br><br>According to Lili Gatlin(1971), In a system, the probability that something will happen vs. something else happening is due to constraints. E.g. Our skeleton system constraints self-organization so that we get a humanly shaped body. Scholars like Kauffman(1993) also emphasized this role of constraints on the direction of evolution caused by self-organization. <br><br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(ll) where I will introduce two types of constraints(context-free &amp; context-sensitive) as a dynamic and adaptive design solution to aid the effectuation of self-organization.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.

If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. As discussed previously, entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science (McKelvey, 2004). Despite this reality, most entrepreneurship models and perspectives are reductionist in their origin, prescription, or omission. To solve this weakness this framework adopts an ecological world view, i.e a complex, dynamic, connected, and evolving ecology. \n<br>\n<br>In order to understand the ecological view, let's first go through some of the existing world views or alternatives. After that, I will introduce the ecological view to show how it is different from other world views. \n<br>\n<br><b>1. Single Model world view:</b> This is the world view based on a single model, tool, or method which assumes superiority over all others. This can be equated to what Charlie Munger(1994) calls, “Man with a Hammer” syndrome, which is the idea that if an individual has only one tool or model(e.g. hammer), he'll approach all of his problems with the same solution, i.e. a hammer. For a man with a hammer, everything around him will seem like a nail. Most models in entrepreneurship come under this category. They are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one and are pitched as better than the previous one. E.g. Lean startup (Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011) Vs Business planning or any other model that is proposed as vastly superior to others.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>2. Multiple-Model Ensembles: </b>This world view suggests the complementary use of multiple models or methods. This is the same idea as suggested by Scott Page(2018) and the ensemble forecasting model (Leutbecher and Palmer, 2008) used in weather prediction. In entrepreneurship, multiple model world view can be found in many scholarly works. For e.g. Sarasvathy(2001)stressed the importance of both effectuation and causation. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) suggested using multiple methods complementing each other. This world view is by default inclusive of the previous one.&nbsp;A very common place in which multiple models are used in this way is the university curriculum. <b>Note that</b> <i>works of scholars like<b>&nbsp;</b>Page, Sarasvathy, Lackéus, Mansoori, etc are generally not exclusionist, and the above analysis should be viewed only in the context of specific works or comments cited</i>.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>3. Cognitive-Diversity world view:</b> This world view suggests using not only formal models or methods but all kinds of cognitive diversity. E.g. Models, methods, theories, heuristics, etc. Scott Page defines Cognitive Diversity as “Differences in information, knowledge, representations, mental models, and heuristic, to better outcomes on specific tasks such as problem-solving, predicting, and innovating (Page, 2017,14-15)\". To me, the weakness of this view is in its cognitive reductionism. Even though this world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones, any cognitive alone worldview can be criticized for lack of ecological basis (Gibson, 1979; Varela et al., 1991; Clark, 1997). \n<br><br><b>4. Holistic Diversity worldview:</b> Apart from cognitive diversity, Page(2017) also talks about identity diversity, i.e. the differences in race, gender, age, physical capabilities, and sexual orientation. There are other frames to view diversities like; Biodiversity, which can be defined as variety in all forms of life—from genes to species to ecosystems (Wood, 1997); Cultural diversity, which can be defined as differences, such as in language, religion, dress and moral codes that exist between people according to race and ethnicity (Leveson et al, 2009; Kossek and Zonia, 1993). Tool diversity suggesting for the use of multiple tools for the same task to increase output accuracy by reducing systematic errors (Song et al, 2018). Artifact diversity refers to the number of different classes of artifacts and their relative proportions (Lyman and O'Brien, 2000). In short, this world view suggests the existence of not only Cognitive-Diversity but also, all other kinds of diversity, i.e. diversity in people, biology, identity, networks, information sources, relational-expertise, institutions, culture, location, specialization, artifacts, tools, etc. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. \n<br><br><b>5. Ecological View:</b> This includes a continuous effort to capture the true ecological reality in its dynamics. In addition to the previously listed holistic diversity, this view is inclusive of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, interaction, etc. Complexity involves features and interactive dynamics as in a complex adaptive system. The idea of evolution suggests that existing elements interact, evolve, co-evolve into new diversities, variations, etc. It must also involve cumulative cultural evolution(and intelligence) as proposed by human cultural evolution studies\n(Tennie et al, 2009; Mesoudi and Thornton, 2018). In addition, an ecology is connected, hence no clear local-global separation is possible. This is particularly significant in human social ecology. Finally, the ecological view involves the use of contextualized sense-making that suggests that every human context is an emergent property and hence each context has unique types of characters. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones.<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 1\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.

Apart from our previous discussion based on diversity, the Ecological worldview can be better understood scientifically by differentiating it from the Newtonian and Darwinian worldviews or window (Pendleton and Brown, 2018, P. 35). While the Newtonian worldview represented a reductionist approach with an eternally unchanging universe, the Darwinian worldview focused on processes involved in evolution and suggests that the characteristics and behavior of something is contingent on its history. Even though the Darwinian worldview introduced a very important shift in perspective, it cannot explain the more radical changes that structure our universe (Pendleton and Brown, 2018; Ulanowicz, 2009). To Pendleton and Brown(2018, P. 35) ecological window represents complex systems processes that are dependent upon the vibrant exchange and flow of energy and matter between many organisms, their communities, and their environment. <br><br>According to Capra(1996, p.3), the ecological worldview grew out of an awareness that contemporary problems cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are interconnected and interdependent. He uses the term ‘deep ecology’ to highlight the inescapable connections and mutual influences among the human, natural, physical, and constructed environments implicit in this view of reality (Mitchell and Sackney, 2011, p.2). The deep ecology(Arne Naess, 1973) is different from shallow ecology, which is human-centered. Shallow ecology views humans as above or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental value to nature. Deep ecology does not separate humans--or anything else-from the natural environment. It sees the world not as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent (Capra, 1996).&nbsp;<br><br>This is a perspective to ecological complexity that involves properties like holistic interconnection, interdependence, heterogeneous agents, non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, emergent property, self-organization, dynamics of evolution, attractor behavior, open exchange of energy and information with their environment, etc. <br><br><b>b) The Micro-ecological dimension</b><b><br></b><br>A practical or working definition of ecology can change with the unit of observation, domains or problems, etc. Thus, ecology can be defined in a biological perspective as the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment, while for e.g. if we are looking at the disease ecology, it can be defined as the ecological study of host-pathogen interactions within the context of their environment and evolution (Kilpatrick and Altizer, 2010). Similarly, information ecology may mean the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment (Pekkarinen et al, 2020). Further, ecology can also be of a subdomain(problem or topic), like for e.g. the phenomena of human suffering which comes under mental health. Thus, “ecology” can refer to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him or her (Jadhav, 2015).<br><br>With this practical understanding, this framework operates in the entrepreneurial ecology, where the entrepreneur interacts with multiple agents, institutions, artifacts, problems, etc, to form a complex adaptive interdependent system that emerges in the human socio-cognitive-material space. Thus, on a practical level, the worldview can be viewed perfectly aligned with what J. J Gibson calls the inseparability of animal and the environment. Here animal means entrepreneur, organization, artifacts, etc. According to Gibson(2014), “it is often neglected that the words animal and environment make an inseparable pair. Each term implies the other. No animal could exist without an environment surrounding it. Equally, although not so obvious, an environment implies an animal (or at least an organism) to be surrounded\".  <br><br><b>c) The enactive ecological dimension(via Self-organization and Constraints)<br></b><br>The enactive ecological dimension of the framework is for acting in the world which involves the application of 2 important concepts, Self-organization, and Constraints. This is based on the understanding that complex adaptive systems like entrepreneurship have a tendency to self-organize (Kauffman, 1995) under various constraints. The framework uses constraints-based dynamic design, an idea adapted from the Constraints-Led approach (Davids et al, 2008). The design uses Alicia Juarrero's(1999) conception of Context-free and Context-sensitive constraints, to enable the entrepreneur to self-organize to find better solutions by themselves.<br><br>These ideas will be expanded in part 2(ll) and part 2(lll). The enactive ecological worldview(via Self-organization and Constraints) forms the core praxis of the framework.&nbsp;<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.

Effectual self-organization takes complexity friendly ideas from effectuation theory and ignores the rest of its assumptions.

It was further developed by many scholarly works like Haken(1977), Prigogine(1973), Kauffman(1993), and many others. <br><br>Self-organization refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level (Kauffman, 1995; Ska˚r, 2003; Anzola et al., 2017). According to Cilliars(2002), \"the capacity for self-organisation is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structure spontaneously and adoptively in order to cope with or manipulate, their environment. It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. The final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and design; and it is not known a priori (De Roo, 2016). This can be contrasted with the top-down approaches where planning precedes implementation, and the desired final system is known by design. <br><br>The paradigmatic importance of self-organization was clearly articulated by Kauffman. He introduced the idea of self-organization in ‘Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection’ (1993) by arguing that Darwinian natural selection as a single singular force is inadequate, \"for it fails to notice, fails to stress, fails to incorporate the possibility that simple and complex systems exhibit order spontaneously” through self-organization(Kauffman, 1993: xiii). He argues that natural selection is not the sole source of order in organisms and suggests that both natural selection and self-organisation are necessary for evolution (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). <br><br>Further, in self-organization, there is no hierarchy of command and control and there is no planning or managing, but there is a constant re-organizing to find the best fit with the environment. The system is continually self-organizing through the process of emergence and feedback. It changes the relationships between the distributed elements of the system under influence of both the external environment and the history of the system (Cilliers, 2002). This emergence happens naturally from the interactions within a complex system; they do not need to be imposed top-down in a centralized way. For example, termites are known to construct the highest structures on the planet relative to the size of the builders. Yet there is no chief executive among termites, no architect termite, and no blueprint. Each termite acts locally, following only a few simple shared rules of behavior within a context of other termites also acting locally. The termite mound emerges from this process of self-organization (Plsek and Greenhalgh, 2001). <br><br>In order to get a systematic understanding of what constitutes self-organization, it is ideal to understand what various scholars consider as core and common characteristics of self-organization. Two recent scholarly works De Wolf and Holvoet(2004) and Gilbert et al(2015) have discussed these commonly found characteristics/factors across various definitions. Both of them found 4 factors each. De Wolf and Holvoet(2004) listed Increase in Order, Autonomy, Adaptability or Robustness w.r.t. changes, Dynamical i.e. far-from-equilibrium. Gilbert et al(2015) listed four factors that are common across definitions; Pattern formation, Autonomy, Robustness and resilience, Dynamics.<br>\n<br><b>Combining both will give the following 5 characteristic dimensions. </b><br><b><br>1. Increase in Order \n<br></b>\n<br>According to De Wolf and Holvoet(2004), one important characteristic of self-organisation is the ‘organisation’ part of the concept which refers to the arrangement of selected parts so as to promote a specific function. This restricts the behaviour of the  system in such a way as to confine it to a smaller volume of its state space. In essence, organisation can be looked at as an increase in the order of the system behaviour which enables the system to acquire a spatial, temporal, or functional structure.   \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Pattern formation. \n<br></b>\n<br>The basic idea of self-organization relates to pattern formation. To Gershenson et al(2020), Self-organization can be broadly defined as the ability of a system to display ordered spatiotemporal patterns solely as the result of the interactions among the system components. Processes of this kind characterize both living and artificial systems.   The phrase “self-organizing system” is used when an external observer perceives a pattern in a system with many components, and this pattern is not imposed by a central authority among or external to those components, but rather arises from the collective behavior of the elements themselves.  To Gilbert et al(2015), for more complicated systems like societies, robust criteria regarding organization are required. <br>\n<br><b>3. Autonomy\n<br></b>\n<br>This refers to the absence of external control. A system needs to organise without interference from the outside. Further, the lack of external control and autonomy does not mean that such a system can have no input at all. Input is still possible as long as the inputs are no control instructions from outside the system.  The decision on what to do next should be made completely inside the system, i.e. the system is autonomous. \n<br>\n<br>To Gilbert et al(2015), Social systems pose two particular challenges for this feature of self-organizing systems. First, there are asymmetric power relations between and within levels. Humans are intentional actors and can have designs on controlling or influencing a system through individual or institutional action, for example, by the implementation of public policy. Second, the boundaries of social systems and subsystems are difficult to draw. Social science often ignores or is vague about boundaries, both for theoretical and methodological reasons. <br>\n<br><b>4. Robustness, Resilience, and Adaptability. \n<br></b> \n<br>To De Wolf and Holvoet(2004), in self-organizing systems, robustness is used in terms of adaptability in the presence of perturbations and change. A self-organising system is expected to cope with that change and to maintain its organisation autonomously. This adaptability implies the need for the system to be able to exhibit a large variety of behaviours. \n<br>  \n<br>On the other hand, according to  Gilbert et al(2015), although robustness and resilience are two terms, they are often used interchangeably. Robustness refers to a system’s ability to resist change, whereas resilience refers to a system’s ability to adapt or recover from change. Further, both concepts could be used for the same process, depending on the observer’s perspective, meaning it is not always clear whether a social system is robust or resilient.  \n<br><br><b>5. Dynamics, Dynamical, i.e. far-from-equilibrium \n<br></b>\n<br>According to De Wolf and Holvoet(2004), an essential property of self-organisation is that it is a process. Over time, there is an increase in order, i.e. a dynamic towards more order. This can otherwise be viewed as a far-from-equilibrium system that is always in dynamics in order to maintain its organised structure(Glansdorff and Prigogine, 1978). A far-from-equilibrium system is more fragile and sensitive to changes in the environment, but also more dynamic and capable to react.\n<br>\n<br>On the other hand, according to Gilbert et al(2015), the exact role that the concept of dynamics plays in the study of SODS(self-organizing dynamic systems) is dependent on the conceptualization of self-organization. Some portray self-organization as leading to an equilibrium or attractor state, whereas others highlight the processes and dynamics of a system. The explanation given by De Wolf and Holvoet(2004) is a combination apparently.&nbsp;<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>3.

I argue that the heuristics of effectuation is compatible with the fundamental features self-organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b>\n<br><b>Theory of Effectuation \n<br></b>\n<br>The theory of effectuation suggests that under conditions of uncertainty, entrepreneurs adopt a decision logic that is different from that explained by a traditional, more rational model of entrepreneurship called “causation”. It is described by Sarasvathy (2008) as “a logic of entrepreneurial expertise, a dynamic and interactive process of creating new artifacts in the world\" (Sarasvathy and Dew, 2005; Sarasvathy, 2008). According to her, causal logic is based on the premise that; ‘To the extent we can predict the future, we can control it.’ An effectual logic is based on the premise that; ‘To the extent we can control the future, we do not need to predict it’ (Saraswathy, 2001). \n<br>\n<br>Effectuation dictates that; In highly uncertain and dynamic environments, target customers can only be defined ex-post through whoever buys a product or service. Goals change, are shaped and constructed over time and are sometimes formed by chance. Instead of focusing on goals, the entrepreneur exerts control over the available set of means—the things over which the entrepreneur has control (Fisher, 2012). \n<br>\n<br><b>Saraswathy developed the theory of effectuation from her research on so called expert entrepreneurs. In that, she claim to have found the following process elements of entrepreneurial expertise (Saraswathy, 2008. p.15). \n<br></b>\n<br>1. Expert entrepreneurs begin with who they are, what they know, and whom they know, and immediately start taking action and interacting with other people. \n<br>\n<br>2. They focus on what they can do and do it, without worrying much about what they ought to do. \n<br>\n<br>3. Some of the people they interact with self-select into the process by making commitments to the venture. \n<br>\n<br>4. Each commitment results in new means and new goals for the venture. \n<br>\n<br>5. As resources accumulate in the growing network, constraints begin to accrete. The constraints reduce possible changes in future goals and restrict who may or may not be admitted into the stakeholder network. \n<br>\n<br>6. Assuming the stakeholder accumulation process does not prematurely abort, goals and networks concurrently converge into a new market and a new firm. \n<br>\n<br><b>She further adds that, at each step of the process, expert entrepreneurs use the following principles (Saraswathy, 2008, p.15). \n<br></b>\n<br>1. The bird-in-hand principle: This is a principle of means-driven (as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. \n<br>\n<br>2. The affordable-loss principle: This principle prescribes committing in advance to what one is willing to lose rather than investing in calculations about expected returns to the project. \n<br>\n<br>3. The crazy-quilt principle: This principle involves negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. Furthermore, who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa. \n<br>\n<br>4. The lemonade principle: This principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. \n<br>\n<br>5. The pilot-in-the-plane principle: This principle urges relying on and working with the human agency as the prime driver of opportunity rather than limiting entrepreneurial efforts to exploiting exogenous factors such as technological trajectories and socioeconomic trends.<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 3\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>4.

(2.) Paul Cillier's 8 General attributes of self-organizing systems. This is to demonstrate to the readers the similarity and compatibility of effectuation and self-organization phenomena.<br><br><b>Five characteristics dimension of self-organizing systems under effectuation\n<br></b>\n<br>An evaluation of effectuation based on the 5 characteristic dimensions discussed in the previous chapter will help us understand if effectuation is compatible with major qualities of self-organization considered by scholars <br>\n<br><b>1. Increase in Order </b><b><br></b><br>The effectual self-organizing entrepreneur in the process will organize a relational arrangement. Here, the term \"organization\" refers to the arrangement of selected parts so as to promote a specific function. This restricts the behavior of the system in such a way as to confine it to a smaller volume of its state space. Think of a lemonade stand or tea shop or an app for booking doctors' appointment, all of which has an organized purpose rather than a chaotic confusion. \"Such organization can be looked at as an increase in the order of the system behavior which enables the system to acquire a spatial, temporal, or functional structure\"(De Wolf and Holvoet, 2004). \n<br><br><b>2. Pattern formation. \n<br></b>\n<br>Once an effectual entrepreneur self-organize to develop a product/service/venture, it can be objectively observable as a pattern. The idea is very much related to the previous one, i.e. \"increase in the order\" via organization. Various patterns emerge solely as the result of the interactions among the effectual entrepreneur, stakeholders, institutions, artifacts, etc. More importantly, this pattern is not imposed by a central authority or by those external to those components, but rather arises from the collective behavior of the elements themselves. They instead use context-driven effectual principles like bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Autonomy \n<br></b>\n<br>Effectuation is proposed against the idea of causal prescriptive models like lean-startup. One of the core premises of effectuation is the absence of external control. Such a level of autonomy in effectual entrepreneurship does not mean that entrepreneurs cannot have any kind of information or input. Input is possible as long as such inputs are no control instructions from outside the system.\n<br>\n<br><b>4. Robustness, Resilience, and Adaptability. \n<br></b>\n<br>Self-organizing systems are known to have better Robustness, Resilience, and Adaptability than systems that follow rigid prescriptions. I argue that all of the principles of effectuation embody these three ideas(Robustness, Resilience, and Adaptability). The bird-in-hand allows the entrepreneur to understand his dispositional qualities than worrying about unachievable things or past failures. The lemonade principle points to the idea of embracing the emergent realities whether it is good or bad. It can be understood with the famous expression in mind, \"when life gives you lemons make lemonade\". \n<br>\n<br><b>5. Dynamics, Dynamical, i.e. far-from-equilibrium \n<br></b>\n<br>This is the most obvious aspect of effectuation. It is about taking action and dynamics. According to De Wolf and Holvoet(2004), an essential property of self-organisation is that it is a process. Effectuation principles are also based on process elements proposed by Saras Saraswathy (Saraswathy, 2008. p.15).   \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Paul Cillier's General attributes of self-organizing systems with reference to effectuation. \n<br></b>\n<br>According to Paul Cilliers, “the capacity for self-organisation is a property of complex systems which enables them to develop or change internal structure spontaneously and adoptively in order to cope with, or manipulate, their environment”. To him, different systems that share the property of self-organisation will not necessarily exhibit the same range of characteristics. A living cell can certainly be classified as self-organizing, but its internal structure will be more stable than that of an economic system of a country. An economic system is self-organizing in the sense that it changes its internal structure in response to a large number of factors (money supply, growth rate, political stability, natural disasters, etc.). To him, despite these important differences between various self-organizing systems with different functions, there are shared attributes that conform to the framework of the general model for complex systems. \n<br>\n<br>In the following part, I will attempt to demonstrate the self-organization attributes of Saraswathy’s(2009) effectual entrepreneurship by comparing it with the 8 attributes of self-organization listed by Cilliers. According to Cilliers, general attributes of self-organizing systems include the following: \n<br>\n<br><b>(i) The structure of the system is not the result of an a priori design, nor is it determined directly by external conditions. It is a result of interaction between the system and its environment. \n<br></b><br>In effectuation the emergence of structure or order is not the result of an a priori design, nor is it determined directly by external conditions. It is a result of interaction between the system and its environment. Effectuation is not about top-down design, control, or delegation for an external agent. Effectuation is thus introduced as the inverse of causation. In which, Causal models begin with an effect to be created. They seek either to select between means to achieve those effects or to create new means to achieve preselected ends. \n<br>\n<br><b>(ii) The internal structure of the system can adapt dynamically to changes in the environment, even if these changes are not regular. \n<br></b><br>The crazy-quilt and lemonade principles of effectuation correspond to this aspect. The crazy-quilt principle suggests co-evolving and co-adapting with other agents while negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. Here, the important stress of Saraswathy is that “Who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa”. Secondly, the lemonade principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. \n<br>\n<br><b>(iii) Self-organisation is not merely the result of processes like feedback or regulation that can be described linearly. It involves higher-order, nonlinear processes that cannot be modelled by sets of linear differential equations. \n<br></b><br>I argue that the entire effectuation logic is based on adapting to the potentialities of the environment by using it. This cannot be modeled by linear equations. More specifically the lemonade principle suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. \n<br>\n<br><b>(iv) Self-organisation is an emergent property of a system as a whole (or of large enough sub-systems). The system’s individual components only operate on local information and general principles. The macroscopic behaviour emerges from microscopic interactions that by themselves have a very meagre information content (only traces). \n<br></b><br>The logic of effectuation acknowledges emergent property(not by explicitly naming it emergent property, but by implication) and its adaptive nature is part of this acknowledgment. Here also the lemonade principle needs stress because it is really the application of how to deal with surprises generated by such emergent property. Further, even though all of the five core principles( bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane)are based on adaptive logic, in real dynamics we must also take into account two concurrent cycles: expanding means and converging goals. The expanding-means cycle looks for increases in resources, and the Converging goals cycle adapts the goals. “It accretes constraints on the venture that converge into specific goals that get embodied in an effectual artifact over time” (Sarasvathy et al, 2014; Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005, pp. 543–544). According to Saraswathy, “The history of new market creation is full of unusual partnerships leading to the emergence of new networks. Instead of arising naturally as a consequence of existing social networks, several of these seminal relationships began through unplanned encounters or serendipitous events” (Saraswathy, 2008, p.118) \n<br>\n<br><b>(v) Self-organizing systems increase in complexity…..(trimmed). The increase in complexity may also form part of the explanation why self-organizing systems tend to age. Since these systems are bound by the finite constraints of the physical world, they inevitably become saturated at some point. \n<br></b><br>The effectual process begins in the effectual adjacent zone. It initiates the process from the means available and by doing the things the entrepreneur can do. The means will expand, goals will change, many stakeholders will join in bringing their insights to the table, etc. The effectual cycle is a continuous process that scans for changes in core dispositional realities. This accounts to an increase in overall complexity of the system.&nbsp;Further, there is no explicit mentioning of saturation of organization in effectuation, but since the human agency is capable of awareness, solutions can be designed to an extend. As the pilot-in-the-plane principle suggest, “we can work with human agency as the prime driver”. \n<br>\n<br><b>(vi) Self-organisation is impossible without some form of memory, a point closely related to the previous one. Without memory, the system can do no better than merely mirror the environment. A self-organizing system therefore always has a history…(Trimmed) \n<br></b><br>According to De Wolf and Holvoet(2004), in a self-organizing system,\"...‘the arrangement of selected parts’ implies that the arrangement is a kind of historic memory of the process that becomes bigger when more and more parts are arranged\". In effectuation the entrepreneur start by acting in the adjacent possible. Gradually, more and more parts(agents, institutions, artifacts, etc) will be added to form part of the memory of the system. The effectual process involves a continuous cycle of going back to the dispositional factors like means, goals, and direction. This, I argue, is because the memory of a complex system is embedded in its disposition(position &amp; propensity) itself through the ‘the arrangement of selected parts’. It is also distributed across the system. This can also be viewed as a system that augments its behavior with an associative memory of various attractors (Watson, 2011). In entrepreneurship, attractors can be many things like intentions, money, product, customers, stakeholders, vision statement, etc. This is also why Complex systems like entrepreneurship are path-dependent (Liebovitz and Margolis, 1995) and subject to Imprinting (Levinthal, 2003; Johnson, 2007) and lock-ins(Arthur, 1989). <br><br><b>(vii) Since the self-organizing process is not guided or determined by specific goals, it is often difficult to talk about the function of such a system. Self-organisation in complex systems cannot be driven by the attempt to perform a function; it is rather the result of an evolutive process whereby a system will simply not survive if it cannot adapt to more complex circumstances. \n<br></b><br>Effectuation explicitly embraces this idea of not having specific goals driving actions. In effectuation, goals are driven by means and other interacting agents. This points to the coevolutionary potential of the entrepreneur and stakeholders both. According to the bird-in-hand principle, effectuation is means-driven (as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. Further, Each stakeholder commitment results in new means and new goals for the venture. \n<br>\n<br><b>(viii) Similarly, it is not possible to give crudely reductionistic descriptions of self-organising systems. Since microscopic units do not ‘know’ about large-scale effects, while at the same time these effects manifest themselves in collections that do not involve anything besides these microscopic units, the various ‘levels’ of the system cannot be given independent descriptions. The levels are in principle intertwined. </b><br><br>Though not the first one, effectuation can be viewed as a shift from major reductionistic approaches that existed in entrepreneurship research that focused on a few isolated aspects like personality, attitude, or other personal or observables. This is evident from her comparison of effectuation with her doctoral advisor Herbert Simon’s concept of near-decomposable systems (Simon and Ando,1961) where she argues that “both effectuation and near-decomposability exploit locality and contingency in the evolution of the artifact. Just as effectuation creates rapidly evolving artifacts that leverage the interdependence of parts to exploit locality and contingency, so near-decomposability in the structure of such systems leverages the independence of parts to exploit the same locality and contingency. While effectuation stitches together pieces of entrepreneurial fabric into economic quilts that continue to make sense in an interactive and dynamically changing environment, ND identifies lines of ‘tearing’ so that entrepreneurship as a science of the artificial pieces can be reworked in synchrony with the overall pattern as the needs imposed by the environment change” (Saraswathy, 2008,p.165-166).&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 4\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">\n                                   <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>5.

In this part I will discuss the reason why the expertise theory of effectuation is flawed.<br><br><b>Unshackling effectuation from expertise \n<br></b>\n<br>The empirical evidence for effectuation came from the study of expert entrepreneurs conducted by Saraswathy. She contrasts her study on entrepreneurial expertise with entrepreneurial performance that has been traditionally studied either (1) as a set of personality traits of the entrepreneur that explains the success or failure of the firms he or she creates (Llewellyn and Wilson, 2003), or (2) as a set of circumstances or attributes of the project and its environment that contains the seeds of its success or failure (Thornton, 1999). In that, she conducted a cognitive science-based study of entrepreneurial expertise using think-aloud verbal protocols. Included in that, a 17-page problem set of 10 typical decisions in a startup firm and had a representative sample of 27 expert entrepreneurs. \n<br>\n<br><b>In this framework, I am approaching or using effectuation as a praxis/logic for complex domains, particularly in social complexity, not just as possessions of expert entrepreneurs. Following are some reasons; \n<br></b><br>\n<br><b>Firstly,</b> entrepreneurship is a low validity domain (Kahneman and Klein, 2009) with extreme levels of complexity. To have genuine expertise to develop, the domains must be of high validity. i.e. \"Skilled intuitions will only develop in an environment of sufficient regularity, which provides valid cues to the situation\" (Kahneman and Klein, 2009). This was also previously spotted in a review by Shanteau(1992), in which he confirmed the importance of predictable environments and opportunities to learn them, in order to develop real expertise. To Kahneman and Klein(2009) prolonged practice and feedback that is both rapid and unequivocal are necessary conditions for expertise, provided by predictable environments. To be more specific about the contrast, Immediate Feedback, Repeatability &amp; Regular environment are the fundamental conditions to develop expertise. Entrepreneurship is characterized by the opposite; Delayed feedback, Non-Repeatability, Irregular complex, and emergent environment.<br><br><b>Secondly,</b> the effectiveness of deliberate practice as claimed by effectuation will not work in complex domains like entrepreneurship. There is no scientific evidence of it. Saraswathy(2008) defines an expert as someone who has attained a high level of performance in a domain as a result of years of experience and deliberate practice (Ericsson et al, 1993). Against this, Baron (2009) raised the important problem, ie “In what tasks or activities do successful entrepreneurs demonstrate expert performance?”. Advancing that point, Baron and Henry (2010) argued that deliberate practice may not be possible in entrepreneurship and that entrepreneurs instead either learn vicariously or transfer skills learned through practice in other domains into their new ventures. Frankish et al(2013) specifically questioned the idea of learning from experience. They pointed to the lack of repetition opportunities (owing to task diversity) and the difficulty of interpreting the various causes of new venture survival, suggesting that entrepreneurs improve performance only partially based on their experience at running new ventures. Further, in recent scholarly works it has been demonstrated that deliberate practice may not guarantee better performance in extremely complex domains. A 2014 meta-analysis (Macnamara et al, 2014) has shown that deliberate practice only explained 26% of the variance in performance for games, 21% for music, 18% for sports, 4% for education, and less than 1% for professions. This further demonstrates a low connection between deliberate practice and performance in complex unstructured domains. \n<br>\n<br><b>Thirdly,</b> expertise in complex social domains is distributed (Edwards, 2010). It is not necessary that an entrepreneur must be an expert in finance, accounting, programming, law, etc. Such expertise is distributed(and or extended) across various individuals(lawyer, doctor) institutions(law enforcement, companies) and artifacts(tools, software). etc. It is not even necessary that the entrepreneur know the entrepreneurial core activities. He can still win in-case he is in the right high network place(e.g. Harvard, Stanford, etc.), get good people to mentor and work(e.g. Facebook case of Sean Parker, Peter Thiel), get access to specialized institutions(e.g. YC in the case of Dropbox), have a rich family to support, etc. He can also fail despite all of this(see next). \n<br>\n<br><b>Fourthly,</b> complex domains like entrepreneurship are subjected to various complexity laws like power laws, Mathew effects, reputation effects, ecosystem-embedded-preferential-attachment, etc. This invalidates success as a metric of expertise. Core events in complex systems like entrepreneurship never repeat in originality(strange attractor effect), feedback is delayed, and since complex systems are governed by power laws, small things(e.g. Harvard dorm Facebook) can result in huge success, and resource rich interventions can fail(google plus). A tangent is that the emergent property of a system may not be the result of the expertise of a particular agent or agents, but because of the dynamics of the whole system co-evolving with the ecosystem as a whole. This may prevent us from establishing any valid causal relationship between expertise and performance in a domain like entrepreneurship. Thus in complexity, high performance may not guarantee success, in that, the success of an individual does not depend uniquely on the quality of performance (Barabási, 2018).&nbsp;<br><br>\n<b>Fifthly,</b>&nbsp;I believe that, like the personality view of entrepreneurial achievement (McClelland,1951, 1961; Llewellyn and Wilson, 2003), the expertise view may also have some unintended counter-productive effects. It can legitimize the hubris among successful entrepreneurs, and at the same time make the aspiring entrepreneurs think that they may require deliberate practice to become a successful entrepreneur, while in-fact success could be the result of complexity-effects like Mathew effects, reputation effects, preferential attachment, etc. \n<br>\n<br><b>Sixthly,</b>&nbsp;A very important question to ask here is; Is it even desirable to start multiple ventures than making one single venture successful. Why does people start multiple ventures? Is it because they see it like playing chess or golf? Will they start another venture if they are incredibly successful in the first business? Will a few outlier cases like Elon Musk ethically suffice us to prescribe it as a standard scientific way of thinking about the world?&nbsp;Does multiple successful marriages make someone marriage expert, or unlucky and bad at marriage?. The key point I am trying to make here is that in domains like chess, multiple success maybe a sign of expertise. In many extremely complex questions of life it maybe undesirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br><b>Seventhly</b>,&nbsp;&nbsp;as I have demonstrated, most effectuation principles corresponds to the dynamics of self-organizing complex system. This means it must not be limited to entrepreneurs. Herbert Simon also hinted at this aspect and suggested that there might be a connection between effectuation and Near Decomposibility (Sarasvathy and Simon, 2000). According to him (Saraswathy, 2008), Near Decomposibility is an astonishingly ubiquitous principle in the architecture of rapidly evolving complex systems, and effectuation appears to be a preferred decision model with entrepreneurs who have created high-growth firms, we should be able to link Near Decomposibility to the processes these entrepreneurs use to create and grow enduring firms–whether in an experimental situation or in the real world (Saraswathy, 2008, p.163). But instead of trying out a more fundamental complexity science based explanation of entrepreneurial behaviour, Saraswathy used the expertise theory to build the theory of effectuation.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Finally</b>, I believe that effectuation is widely applicable in other domains. It has application in complex domains like education, learning, economics, politics, etc. Framing effectuation as a science of action in social complexity will open up a lot of possibilities. This also will make the theory more robust and useful.<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 5\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>6.

I have found that the ideas proposed by effectuation fit perfectly with self-organization principles. I have also listed reason why expertise theory of effectuation is flawed and should be abandoned. <br><br><b>Following is a complexity science based explanation to effectuation which form the fundamental praxis or primary constraint of the ESOLoop Framework, i.e. Effectual self-organization.<br></b><br><b>1. Self-Organization/Effectual dynamics \n<br></b>\n<br>As I have been hinting throughout this part effectual dynamics is the dynamics of self-organization. Self-Organization refers to the feature of systems that appear to organize themselves without external direction or control. Self-organization has been used to describe swarms, flocks, traffic, and many other systems where the local interactions lead to a global pattern or behavior (Camazine et al., 2003; Gershenson, 2007). Intuitively, self-organization implies that a system increases its own organization. Self-organization of the effectual entrepreneur is initiated with an examination of the means available to an entrepreneur. The questions “Who am I?”, “What do I know?”, and “Whom do I know?” allow for an examination of the means available to an entrepreneur, which allows him or her to consider what he or she can do (Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005). Through interacting with others and engaging with stakeholders, the entrepreneur discovers new means and establishes new goals that allow for revaluation of means and possible courses of action (Fisher, 2012). \n<br>\n<br><b>2. The attractor/ Intention \n<br></b>\n<br>Self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Almost any dynamical system can be seen as self-organizing; if it has an attractor towards which the system dynamics will tend to move, thus increasing by itself its own organization. According to Kauffman(1995), \"the trajectory converges onto a state-cycle attractor around which the system will cycle persistently thereafter. A variety of different trajectories may all converge on the same state cycle, like water draining into a lake. The state-cycle attractor is the lake, and the trajectories converging onto it constitute its basin of attraction\". So the question is, Who or what constitutes one of the key initial attractor according to effectuation. Is it the entrepreneur, or intention? Since effectuation has a lot of roots in the work of Herbert Simon, especially \"The Sciences of the Artificial\" (Simon, 1968), I prefer to take evidence from his work, quoted by Saraswathy herself; \"For Simon, human intention and design were central to the social sciences, and the word ‘man-made’ was synonymous with artificial\" (Sarasvathy, 2008). From that foundation, it is logical to assume recognition of \"intention as the attractor (Juarrero, 2010)\". Intention is also a valid concept in entrepreneurship (Bird, 1989; Shapero and Sokol, 1982; Krueger and Carsrud, 1993). According to Juarrero(2004), \"new intention reorganize the earlier state space into a more differentiated and complex set of qualitatively novel options. This means that once an agent formulates a prior intention, every possible behavioral alternative no longer requires consideration; only a partitioned subset does\". \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Phase space disposition \n<br></b>\n<br>According to Saraswathy, the process elements of effectuation begin with entrepreneurs asking who they are, what they know, and whom they know. This corresponds to the idea of knowing the disposition of phase space or state space of a complex adaptive system. In complexity science, the 'phase space'(or state space) is the representation of all possible instantaneous states that can occur in a physical system (Butkovskiy 1990, Sayama 2015). It can be thought of as the space within, around, or adjacent to which a complex adaptive system can self-organize and emerge. While we may not be able to know precisely how a system might change, we do know that it will be most likely within the phase space. A change in emergent phenomena within a phase space may be incremental. A radical change suggests a shift in phase space, a qualitative difference in the system (Byrne &amp; Callaghan, 2014). According to Dave Snowden(2017a), in complex adaptive systems, “at a system level, we have no linear material cause but instead we have a dispositional state, a set of possibilities and plausibilities in which a future state cannot be predicted.” This is particularly important because, in a complex system, phase space disposition, is what decides on the evolutionary potential of the system, not any specific fixed goal. If a system is complex(no causality), “you can’t set outcome targets a priori, but you can define a vector target (direction and speed of change from the present against intensity of effort). You can’t manage to a desired future state but have to manage the evolutionary potential of the situated present. You can’t predict the future, but you can increase resilience in there the here and now which will allow you to manage that uncertainty” (Snowden, 2017b). \n<br>\n<br>This importance of disposition can also be found in the works of scholars who specialize in entrepreneurship complexity. According to Jeffrey Goldstein, Self-transcending Constructions (Goldstein, 2003), which involve the emergence of radically novel outcomes----operate on already extant order and creatively transform it along the way into radically novel outcomes. \n<br>\n<br>Following are some sources of this pre-existing order that are processed by Self-transcending Constructions (Goldstein, 2005); \n<br>1. The already present nascent order in a system, i.e., the way it is functioning right now; \n<br>2. The multifarious constraints currently in place, e.g., the geographical layout, the actual buildings, the already extant work groups, the constraints of money, time, goals, and so forth; \n<br>3. Operations of recombining and manipulating the above; \n<br>4. Supplemental means for introducing novelty such as randomization and negation, i.e., changing the rule. \n<br>\n<br>I argue that an effectual entrepreneur, by asking questions such as; who they are? what they know? and whom they know? etc. effectively is trying to make sense of the dispositional propensities, so that they can utilize the evolutionary potential of the present to decide what to do. \n<br>\n<br><b>4. Adjacent Possible. \n<br></b>\n<br>From the understanding of disposition comes the \"The bird-in-hand principle\" which refers to a principle of means-driven(as opposed to goal-driven) action. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals. To effectuation, entrepreneurs focus on what they can do and do it, without worrying much about what they ought to do. This idea is similar to acting in the adjacent possible (Kauffman, 1996), i.e. a kind of zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978), towards which change and evolution are more likely because of the current disposition of the system. The concept of “adjacent possible” was introduced by Stuart Kauffman (1996; 2000) in evolutionary biology and complex adaptive systems to explain how biological evolution can be seen as exploration and actualization of what is adjacent possible. It can be defined as “the set of possibilities available to individuals, communities, institutions, organisms, productive processes, etc., at a given point in time during their evolution” (Loreto 2015, p. 9). The concept of the “adjacent possible” is useful for understanding how entrepreneurial adjacent possibilities emerge, and how the new adjacent possible will lead to yet newer adjacent possibilities. In the case of effectual entrepreneurs, they will focus on the adjacent possible than worry about things they don't possess. They will focus on what they can do and do it. \n<br>\n<br>Any failure inside the zone of adjacent possible will not likely result in system disorganization, but likely help the development of system resilience. The affordable-loss principle to me is a heuristics based on this idea. It prescribes committing in advance to what one is willing to lose rather than investing in calculations about expected returns to the project. If an effectual entrepreneur commits 6 months and 10000k, that commitment itself will shape the constraints of the adjacent possible. In the constraints based approach I am developing affordable loss is not part of self-organization directly but can be considered an enabling constraint. This will be discussed in upcoming sections.<br>\n<br><b>4. Co-evolution  \n<br></b>\n<br>For a system to self-organize, its elements need to communicate: they need to “understand” what other elements, or mediators, “want” to tell them (Gershenson,2007). Thus, first of all, in a complex system, dynamics of self-organization are initiated and manifested by heterogeneous agents interacting with one another in a non-linear and continuous way. Even if specific agents may only interact with a few others, the impact of these interactions are propagated throughout the system. Accordingly, agents co-evolve with one another(Anderson, 1999). Through this interaction, agents strive to improve their fitness with the environment but the outcome of these attempts depends on the disposition and behaviors of other agents (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). Thus, co-evolution is one of the key themes when it comes to viewing the system as a whole(the nested and entangled relationships with multiple complex adaptive systems), which refers to the simultaneous evolution of entities and their environments, whether these entities are organisms or organizations (Baum &amp; Singh, 1994). It encompasses the twin notions of inter-dependency and mutual adaptation, with the idea that species or organizations evolve in relation to their environments, while at the same time these environments evolve in relation to them. In effectuation, this is parallel to initiated interaction and the crazy-quilt principle. This principle involves interacting and \"negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. Furthermore, who comes on board determines the goals of the enterprise. Not vice versa\". This involves the co-evolutionary potential of interacting agents constituted by the principles we have discussed till now but applied to the other side. They are; The Intention(attractor) of other agents, Phase space disposition of interacting agents, Adjacent-possible of interacting agents. \n<br><br><b>5, Acknowledging and appropriating Emergent property \n<br></b>\n<br>Complex adaptive systems show emergent properties. Emergent properties refer to a characteristic that is found across the system but which individual parts of the system do not themselves hold. E.g. Human heart is made of heart cells. But heart cells on their own don't have the property of pumping blood. You will need the whole heart to be able to pump blood. Thus, the pumping property of the heart is emergent. A complex system like entrepreneurship has emergent property. That means the emergent or emerging venture idea might be different from the ideas the entrepreneur has initially conceived. Thus initial idea may be to start HTML5 supported location-based service; The emergent outcome could be Instagram. The initial idea may be to develop an app to compare two people’s pictures and rate which one was more attractive; The emergent outcome could be Facebook. The lemonade principle of effectuation is based on using, improvising and leveraging the emergent realities, whether it is perceived as negative or positive. It suggests acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. This means accepting the emergent realities as it comes, acknowledging and appropriating the contingencies as it unfolds. \n<br>\n<br>The pilot-in-the-plane principle urges relying on and working with the human agency as the prime driver of opportunity rather than limiting entrepreneurial efforts to exploiting exogenous factors such as technological trajectories and socioeconomic trends. This can be viewed to some degree as an equivalent to elements of Lichtenstein's(2016) concept of generative emergence that views entrepreneurial emergence as intentional, and agency, even if distributed, as the source of successful organizing. To the framework, intention is the primary attractor around which self-organisation takes place. In order for effective self-organization to take place, the agent must use agency, not to exert control that is driven by his/her own bounded rationality, or the rules of perceived local optima, but a kind of agency that is distributed (Garud and Karnøe, 2005)and embedded as well (Garud and Karnøe, 2003) <br>\n<br><b>6. Effectual Self-organisation cycle \n<br></b>\n<br>A complex system is always dispositional and I have discussed quoting Snowden that we can only know the system by how it is disposed. \"you can’t set outcome targets a priori, but you can define a vector target (direction and speed of change from the present against intensity of effort). You can’t manage to a desired future state but have to manage the evolutionary potential of the situated present\". Since the system is always changing, the bird in hand or disposition is also parallelly evolving. This warrants continuous reappraisal of the situated present. The effectual cycle suggests always looping back and cycling through five core principles in a non-linear manner(bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane). More specifically there are two types of converging cycles mentioned; expanding means and converging goals. The expanding-means cycle looks for increases in resources, and the Converging goals cycle adapts the goals. \"It accretes constraints on the venture that converge into specific goals that get embodied in an effectual artifact over time” (Sarasvathy et al, 2014; Sarasvathy &amp; Dew, 2005, pp. 543–544). This is also a feedback about emergent realities that will lead to estimation of the new phase space disposition, new adjacent possible, new co-evolutionary potential, new action, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n</section>",

E.g Human body self-organizes with the constraints of genetics and skeleton system. This means constraints are an integral part of self-organization. This also suggests that the self-organization of an entrepreneurial system is influenced by various kinds of constraints, internal and environmental. Thus such self-organization can be positively influenced by introducing various constraints. <br><br><b>In this part; <br></b><br>1.

Self-organization is a ubiquitous phenomena and like all self-organizing systems, effectual self-organization is also driven by local interactions. Complex adaptive systems have a tendency to self-organize, but the deliberate use of effectual self-organization as a logic makes all the difference. <br><br>While effectual self-organization is adopted as a heuristics to act in the complex entrepreneurial ecology, It is not free from various constraints. The outcome will be mostly determined by constraints by which, through which, and around which self-organization takes place. Like the idea suggested by the bible parable of \"the sower of seed\", only the seeds that fell on the good soil will self-organize to produce great corn. Most seeds may self-organize if provided with basic conditions., but the thriving of the seed to corn or tree depends on many constraints and conditions.&nbsp;<br><br> Following are some of the key concerns when it comes to self-organization in the social world, particularly in entrepreneurship ecology. <br><br><b>The adjacent possible in a hyper-connected and complex social world <br></b><br>The adjacent possible is not locally or geographically bound in the social world. Paul Selden and Denise Fletcher(2015) brilliantly articulated this aspect by quoting works by people like Herbert Simon and Prigogine. They argue that complex social systems are different from biological and physical systems (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984), where hierarchies are distinguished by spatial organization,i.e. ‘relative spatial propinquity’ (Simon, 1962: 469). For example, the subsystems that constitute the complex system of the human body, are spatially organized within the body as a physical entity. In contrast, the interaction of subsystems and subsystem components in social systems is unconstrained by spatial proximity because interaction is mediated by ‘symbolic meaning systems’ (Simon, 1962: 469–470)\". I prefer to call&nbsp;‘symbolic meaning systems’ as a kind of socially available affordances in order to maintain the centrality of ecological basis. Thus in social systems, the local optima may not be located in the geographical adjacency. Further, this aspect is extended and amplified by the technology-mediated connectivity revolution happening around us. This makes it very interesting to study the issue of adjacent possible in a hyper-connected and dynamic social world. In a hyper-connected world, the local-global separation is fast disappearing. Even the local-optima is globally distributed; the adjacent possible is not physical adjacent possible. This means there will always be the possibility of a perceived adjacent possible and there will be an actual adjacent possible. It is possible that the entrepreneurial agent gets stuck in the perceived adjacent possible for long periods of time. <br><br><br><b>Self-organization under bounded conditions(exposure, environment, rationality) <br></b><br>Research has shown that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does to established firms and that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice prematurely across many decisions (Cohen et al, 2018). This satisficing (Simon, 1955) behavior in the adjacent possible is absolutely ideal, but the real problem is whether the entrepreneur is driven by attractors of the local optima or global optima, and whether the entrepreneur will be stuck in the local optima for many years before realizing the existence of an adjacent global-optima. As demonstrated by effectuation, entrepreneurs generally start their venture with a preference to ‘local search’, whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge. This could lead to the identification of local optima rather than global optima (Keinz &amp; Prügl, 2010; Rosenkopf &amp; Nerkar, 2001; Stuart &amp; Podolny, 1996). This was also confirmed by an empirical study done by Shane(2000) that has also shown that entrepreneurs tend to identify opportunities that were either already known to them in the past or are closely related to their existing stock of knowledge. This local search behavior is of inevitable importance but the problem is that focusing on existing knowledge and expertise alone can Impede the entrepreneur from exploring distant solutions or even the real adjacent global optima. <br><br>Further, environmental constraints, including lack of exposure to relevant ideas or models may prevent the travel to global optima. According to innovation historian Anton Howes, \"Absent any exposure to inventors, people simply don’t become inventors. Knowing about invention as an activity is a necessary precondition to becoming an inventor yourself. The vast majority of people never innovate, for the very simple reason that it never occurs to them to do so\" (Howes, 2021). His historical evidence has exposed the importance of proximity, mentoring, community, and reputation in the development of new innovators (Howes, 2017; Howes, 2017a; Howes, 2016). If a person who never have got any exposure to business models other than local brick-and-mortar retail( if he is about to start a business), he will never be able to imagine the possibilities of the internet, platform model, network effect, etc. He will most likely start a business in his local optima, i.e. retail. <br><br><b>Following are key points that I want to point from this discussion. <br></b><br>1. There is no clear local-global separation in the social world. This makes it important to have some visibility towards the dynamics of global state space. Effectual self-organization by default doesn't provide any dispositional capabilities for sense-making or exploration towards the global phase space. <br><br>2.&nbsp; For a design to be sustainable it must acknowledge that the end-users are fallible humans with bounded rationality. It must take into account cognitive limitations, bias, and dysfunctional dispositions. Models must anticipate the potential issues that could arise from bounded rationality and compensate for them with built-in design solutions. Effectual self-organization doesn't provide dispositional capabilities for awareness about bounded rationality or limitation. <br><br>3. Effectual self-organization model cannot by default have functional dispositions as discussed in part 2. This requires deliberate design.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>3.

For this purpose, they often impose a (top-down) primary generator (Darke, 1979) or use bottom-up opportunistic design strategies or combinations of both (Kelso et al, 2016). By doing so designers explore the ‘design territory’ in which the design problem and solution co-evolve (Dorst and Cross 2001). The approach employed by this framework is also based on balancing the contradictions(design and self-organization). I.e., I have already introduced the idea of effectual self-organization in the last part. This part is about constraints-based design for enabling better self-organization. <br><br><b>Self-organization and design <br></b><br>Self-organization depends mostly on the constraints that affect it. This warrants the question, is it possible to design for self-organization?. Is it possible to increase the likelihood of a system moving to an optimal direction than staying in a sub-optimal location, or prevent the system from moving to a dysfunctional state? According to Gershenson(2007), \"designing for self-organization can be very useful in complex systems where the observer cannot a priori conceive of all possible configurations, purposes, or problems that the system may be confronted with. Examples of these are organizations (corporations, governments, communities), traffic control, distributed robotics, allocation of ecologic resources, self-assembling nanotubes, and complex software systems (Heylighen and Gershenson, 2003) such as the Internet\". These examples suggest that domains like engineering are also increasingly using this ambidextrous approach where bottom-up and top-down approaches are used. In engineering, elements are designed to dynamically and autonomously solve a problem or perform a function at the system level(self-organizing). In other words, the engineer will not build a system to perform a function explicitly, but elements will be engineered in such a way that their behavior and interactions will lead to the system function. Thus, for e.g., a car is not a self-organizing system because the parts of a car are designed to drive. Such parts of a car do not change their behavior in time. On the other hand, a swarm of robots (Dorigo et al., 2004) will be conveniently described as self-organizing, since each element of the swarm can change its behavior depending on the current situation (Gershenson, 2017). <br><br>One of the key concerns about this approach is that self-organization generally implies that order emerges spontaneously as a purely bottom-up process. On the other hand, design implies that order and organization come into being by virtue of a designer in a top-down manner. According to Kelso et al(2016), this dichotomy is the wrong way to view this because, self-organization may require both bottom-up and top-down processes, and design that ignores bottom-up collective effects are at its own peril. Likewise, self-organization that happens in human domains can gain a lot from design, since it can deliberately prevent issues like lock-ins in local optima, global blindness, etc. With that insight in mind, this part is about using various constraints to bias the self-organization towards relevant contextual and functional dispositions above mentioned(in part 2). <br><br><br><b>Introduction to Constraints <br></b><br>Constraints in a general sense may be taken as restrictive. But in a complexity perspective constraints have a different understanding. Here, it is important to understand constraints are enabling too. They create opportunities for action, thoughts, and creation. Order in human life is primarily created through constraints. \"It is not something which merely limits possibilities, constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced” (Cilliers, 2001). For example, take the case of road traffic. Without conventions that shape how we drive(left or right), as well as our expectations of other drivers, smooth road transport will not be possible. Take the example of HTML, a constrained protocol that allows us to use the web. A cricket game works as a game because of various constraints like cricket ground, various constrained roles like a bowler, batsman, fielder, keeper, etc, and various associated rules that govern the game. Without this, we wouldn't have cricket as a game (examples adapted from Blignaut, 2021). Therefore, constraints not only remove or limit options but also create or enable order and new possibilities. <br><br>The mentioning of constraints as enabling can also be found in mainstream entrepreneurship research, for e.g. The idea of entrepreneurial Bricolage (Baker and Nelson, 2005) shows how entrepreneurs exploit opportunities despite resource constraints. Further, constraints have found an important place in the research on creativity, in that the concept of \"constraints\" is built into the construct of creativity itself (Sternberg and Kaufman, 2010). Research also has consistently found that without constraints, there can be no creativity (Dyer, Gregersen, and Christensen, 2009; Johnson-Laird, 1988). Both theoretical and empirical contributions investigating the entwinement of creativity and constraints exemplify the dual role of constraints, as constraints can be both limiting and enabling in creative processes (Joyce, 2009; Stokes, 2008, 2005; Negus and Pickering, 2004; Onarheim and Wiltschnig, 2010; Onarheim and Biskjaer; 2013). <br><br><br><b>The Science Of Constraints. <br></b><br>The concept of constraints has a rich background in science. It has been studied for over a hundred years, particularly in the pure sciences like chemistry, physics, biology, and evolution. According to Stuart Kauffman, \"astonishingly simple rules, or constraints, suffice to ensure that unexpected and profound dynamical order emerges spontaneously\" (Kauffman, 1995, p. 1). To Guerin and Kunkle(2004), scientific theories that claim to resolve fundamental issues of organization(self-organization) seek to explain the emergence of organization as an expected consequence of driving constraints forcing systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Listed theories being; Atkins, 1984; Brooks &amp; Wiley, 1988; Kauffman, 2000; Kugler &amp; Turvey, 1987; Prigogine, 1962, 1984; Schneider and Kay, 1994; Swenson, 1989; Tsallis, 1998; Ulanowicz, 1986. This shows that one of the fundamental questions in science is the emergence of order in complex physical, chemical and biological systems as they change over time? That is: how do they evolve, adapt, develop, mature, alter, modify, adjust and (re)organize, etc. And as an answer to these questions, the role of constraints has been studied. <br><br>It has been observed also that the surrounding energy patterns in an environment act as information that constrains complex systems to adapt over different timescales, resulting in different patterns over time. When a complex adaptive system encounters different conditions in the environment, it will self-organize to generate new structures to ‘represent’ those conditions. Self-organization under such constraints is considered ideal because it can develop a distributed form of internal structure (Cilliers, 2002). In this, the structure is neither a passive reflection of the outside, nor a result of active, pre-programmed internal factors, but the result of a complex interaction between the environment, the present state of the system, and the history of the system. In such a system, constraints can shape the emergence of self-organization; of events like movement, cognition, decision making, interactions, social organizations, etc. Further, there must be conditions in the environment that offer such enabling constraints that can limit what the system can do,-- to prevent it from being overwhelmed, but at the same time provide evolutionary potential. <br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 3\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>4.

The use of constraints in designing for complex domains is an ideal practice because of the scientific strength of the concept. For the design of my framework, I am adopting insights from 3 of the most influential perspectives that use constraints-based approach to theory and design. <b>They are;</b> <b><br><br>1.&nbsp;Alicia Juarrero's context-sensitive constraints and context-free constraints, which is developed from the work of&nbsp;Lila Gatlin</b><b>&nbsp;(Juarrero, 1999; Lila Gatlin, 1972). \n<br>\n</b>\n<br>One of the recent philosophical influences that attempted to set clarity on the idea of constraints and use of it as enablers is Alicia Juarrero's \"Dynamics in Action\"(Juarrero, 1999). Juarrero identifies formal uses of the concept of constraints in many places. Two examples she uses are in physical mechanics and information theory. In physical mechanics, she quotes Lindsay(1961, 239) who notes that \"some of the most important cases of constrained motion are those in which particles are connected by rods and strings\" and cannot, therefore, move any which way. Thus in physical mechanics, constraints are said to \"compel \" and \"force\" behavior. The term constraints here suggests not as an external force that pushes, but a thing's connection to something else by rods, cords, strings, and the like as well as to the setting in which the object is situated. She suggests that, in opposition to Newtonian science and modern philosophy's dismissal of relational properties as subjective, Lindsay's \"constraints\" mean something other than Newtonian causality, i.e., as features either of an object's connections with the environment or of its embeddedness in that environment. Constraints are therefore relational properties that parts acquire in virtue of being unified, not just aggregated into a systematic whole. It thus has shown that constraints not only reduce the number of alternatives, they simultaneously create new possibilities. \n<br>\n<br>Secondly, Juarrero introduces information theory, primarily the work of Lila Gatlin to clarify the importance of constraints when transmitting or receiving a message, which requires a clear demarcation between message and background noise. Constraining the number of ways in which the various parts of a system can be arranged reduces randomness by altering the equiprobable distribution of signals, thereby enabling potential information to become actual information. Constraints thus turn the amorphous potential into the definite actual. Constraints work, then, by modifying either a system's phase space or the probability distribution of events and movements within that space. Constraints thus create coherence. \n<br>\n<br>Further, according to Juarrero, Lila Gatlin (1972) distinguishes between two types of constraints: context-free constraints, which take a system's components far from equiprobability, and context-sensitive constraints, which synchronize and correlate previously independent parts into a systemic whole. When organized into a complex, integral whole, parts become correlated as a function of context-dependent constraints imposed on them by the newly organized system in which they are now embedded. A context-free constraint can be seen as a bias, assumption, preference, shared vision, intentions, etc. A context-sensitive constraint is something that is conditional on a state in the context. In entrepreneurship, it can be changing end-user preference, technology penetrations, government policy, infrastructure, etc. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>2. Constraints-led approach(CLA) in sports coaching \n<br></b>\n<br>The CLA is based on the fundamental concept of the mutuality of the performer and environment (Gibson, 2014) in which a learner will self-organize to generate effective movement solutions through the interaction of the three core categories of constraints– task, environment, and individual (Renshaw et al., 2010). The practitioners are therefore encouraged to design learning activities that allow individuals or groups of individuals to self-organize and co-adapt to changing constraints. The CLA has developed and evolved over the years by incorporating key ideas from multiple theoretical perspectives like ecological dynamics theory, ecological psychology, dynamical systems theory, evolutionary biology, and complexity science. It considers athletes and sports teams as complex adaptive systems--a network of highly integrated, interacting sub-components (Renshaw et al., 2010). \n<br>\n<br>CLA acknowledges that Constraints both limit and enable the number of behavioral trajectories that the system can adapt. Complex systems are able to exploit the constraints that surround them in order to allow functional patterns of behavior to emerge in specific contexts. Secondly, CLA views constraints as either physical or informational. Physical constraints can be structural or functional in the human movement system. Functional physical constraints include processes such as reactions and perceptual abilities, which support movement performance. Informational constraints, on the other hand, are the various forms of energy flowing through the system. In complex adaptive systems, the multitude of parts continually forms coordinated patterns(synergies), which are shaped by surrounding such informational constraints. Thus states of order emerge under constraints. This idea has been imported into human movement science from physics and biology, where scientists have been engaged in studying the emergence of movement behaviors under constraints. Some example noted by Davids et al(2007) are Kelso(1995), Kugler(1986), Kugler &amp; Turvey(1987). \n<br><br>The constraints-led approach's fundamental design concept has originated in the work of Newell (1986) who identified the interaction of three core categories of constraints – task, environment, and Organismic(individual), through which a learner will self-organize in his attempt to generate effective movement solutions (Renshaw et al., 2010). The coaching model thus involves manipulating, changing, designing these three core categories of constraints(task, environment, and individual) to promote self-organized capabilities and skills. The specific focus of practitioners is therefore on designing learning activities that allow individuals or groups of individuals to self-organize and co-adapt to changing constraints. \n<br>\n<br><b>The three core categories of Newell's constraints can be elaborated as follows(</b>Davids et al, 2007, p.40)<b>; \n<br></b>\n<br><b>Organismic Constraints: </b>Organismic constraints refer to a person’s characteristics, such as genes, height, weight, muscle–fat ratio, connective strength of synapses in the brain, cognition, motivations, emotions, and all other features that can be added to this category. A crucial difference between other biological organisms and humans is that we can intentionally constrain our actions to achieve goals or desired outcomes. \n<br>\n<br><b>Environmental Constraints:</b> Environmental constraints are global, physical variables in nature, such as ambient light, temperature, or altitude. On Earth, gravity is a key environmental constraint on movement coordination for all tasks Additionally, some environmental constraints are social rather than physical, including family support, peer groups, societal expectations, values, and cultural norms.\n<br>\n<br><b>Task Constraints:</b> Task constraints are usually more specific to performance contexts than environmental constraints are. It include goals, specific rules associated with an activity, activity-related implements or tools, surfaces, ground areas, and pitches and boundary markings such as nets, line markings, and posts. Even with apparently stable activities, such as playing a musical instrument or swinging a golf club, motor behavior can fluctuate because the task constraints may vary from performance to performance. \n<br>\n<br><b>Interacting Constraints:</b> When athletes engage in goal-directed action, the interaction of organismic, environmental, and task constraints on the neuromuscular system results in the emergence of different states of coordination that become optimized with practice and experience. Because of the interactive nature of these constraints, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish among them. This can be called interacting constraints. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>3. Cynefin framework. \n<br></b>\n<br>When it comes to the application of constraints in social and organizational contexts, Dave Snowden's Cynefin is one of the most comprehensive. Cynefin is built as a sense-making meta-framework that uses constraints as the key concept in defining and distinguishing its core typology, ie. It views the constraints of a system as informing and shaping the behavior of that system by modifying its phase space, i.e. its range of possible actions and movements within that space. The construct and evolution of Cynefin are centered on the understanding that complexity in human society is different from other types of complexity. The term Anthro-complexity is used to represent such complexity, which is a way of framing the ordinary, everyday landscape of human interaction. \n<br>\n<br>In Cynefin, constraints play a key role in helping us understand the differences between its key domains in its typology. These typologies are; Clear, Complicated, Complex, and Chaotic. The Clear domain is associated with Rigid constraints, Complicated domain is associated with Governing constraints, Complex domain is associated with Enabling constraints, Chaotic domain is associated with the absence of constraints. \n<br>\n<br>Rigid Constraints are rigid without any possibility or need for breaking it. Deadlines are an example of constraints that are usually intended to be rigid. Governing Constraints give a sense of stability but are sensitive to change. Examples are laws, rules, codes, etc. Enabling constraints are meant to enable us to do something by constraints certain possibilities. For eg, Heuristics and principles provide guidance while allowing for distributed decision-making. And finally, the absence of constraints is viewed as chaotic. Unlike in ordered systems (where the system constrains the agents), or chaotic systems (where there are no constraints), in a complex system, the agents and the system constrain one another, especially over time. This means that we cannot forecast or predict what will happen (Snowden and Boon, 2007 ). \n<br>\n<br>Cynefin also has other types of constraints like; Internal/External Constraints, Connecting/Containing Constraints, Flexible/Permeable Constraints, Dark Constraints, Mutating Constraints, Loose Constraints, Elastic Constraints (Snowden, 2016; Cynefin, 2021).<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 4\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">\n                                   <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>5. Context-Sensitive and Context-Free Constraints</b></h6>\n                                        <span class=\"mbr-iconfont mobi-mbri-arrow-down mobi-mbri\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>Distilled from the previous theoretical and practical&nbsp;models, following are the key insights specifically used for the design of ESO-Loop Framework design. \n</b><br>\n<br><b>Firstly,</b> the core design of the framework is based on  Juarrero's idea of Context-sensitive constraints and context-free constraints. This is taken as proposed by Lila Gatlin's information theory, and as articulated by Alicia Juarrero's philosophical framing in her book Dynamics in action(1999). Context-sensitive constraints are designed based on some of the persisting dimensions of the entrepreneurial state space. Context-free constraints are introduced as desirable functional dispositions that are globally applicable to both the user and the framework itself. This should not be viewed as a permanent structure but as a malleable scaffold (Pendleton and Brown, 2018; Cynefin, 2022a; Bruner, 1978). \n<br>\n<br><b>Secondly,</b> from the constraints-led approach to sports coaching, Newell's(1986) three categories of constraints are preferred to think about various context-sensitive constraints that are in operation in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Apart from the three core categories of constraints–task, environment, and Organismic(individual), in entrepreneurship, it is possible to think about the constraints of or by the socio-material artifact(idea, image, prototype, MVP, startup, etc). Thus apart from the interactive constraints that are an emergent combination of all of the constraints, 4 core categories of constraints can be identified in entrepreneurship; Task, Environment, Organismic(individual), and Socio-material artifact(idea, prototype, MVP, organization, etc). Further, the constrain based coaching model can be used by ecosystem actors to mentor entrepreneurs, in which, when it comes to complex issues, mentors don't give or prescribe solutions, but provide or design constraints that enable the emergence towards a better state depending on the current disposition. \n<br>\n<br><b>Thirdly</b>, the Cynefin framework can be viewed as a globally applicable context-free constraint to design constraints itself according to various dynamic contextual demands. Entrepreneurs may encounter all kinds of situations including contexts like; clear, complicated, complex, and chaotic. All require different actions. Cynefin is specifically insightful when it comes to designing constraints in social domains like entrepreneurship.<br><br><b>Context-sensitive constraints and context-free constraints<br></b><br>According to Juarrero(1999), the context-free constraints takes a system's components far from equiprobability, and context-sensitive constraints, synchronize and correlate previously independent parts into a systemic whole. <br><br>When organized into a complex, integral whole, parts become correlated as a function of context-dependent constraints imposed on them by the newly organized system in which they are now embedded. A context-free constraint can be seen as a bias, assumption, preference, shared vision, intentions, etc. It is something which biases the system even before the contextual factors comes into picture. The context-free constraints(CFC) takes a system's components far from equiprobability. With CFC, anything cannot happen. It positively biases the probability of something happening and at the same time reduces the probability of something else happening. Juarrero(2004) articulates the role of intention as a context free constraint. According to her, \"new intention reorganize the earlier state space into a more differentiated and complex set of qualitatively novel options. This means that once an agent formulates a prior intention, every possible behavioral alternative no longer requires consideration; only a partitioned subset does\". <br><br>A context-sensitive constraint is something that is conditional on a state in the context. In entrepreneurship, it can be entrepreneurial actions, team members, partners, mentors, end-user preference, technology penetrations, government policy, infrastructure, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 5\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>6.

Every entrepreneurial context is different and inside every contexts there are multiplicity of nested and emergent contexts. It can be related to entrepreneurial actions, team members, partners, mentors, end-user preference, technology penetrations, government policy, infrastructure, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>The operation of context-sensitive constraints can be viewed at micro and macro levels. As a framework, the general structure of ESO-Loop cannot be designed to foresee all kinds of constraints applicable to all kinds of users and their contexts, whether it is micro or macro. So the agenda here is not to build a one-size-fits-all rigid model of constraints or to micro-manage for all entrepreneurs. But to build an evolvable, changeable, flexible map of Macro contextual constraints that are globally applicable to all or most of them. Think of it metaphorically as demarcating a football ground (or a map). The ground is an enabling constraint inside which multiplicity of contextual-constraints can co-exist and co-emerge. This could include number of players, skill level, age, rules, etc, all of which can interact, emerge and co-evolve. <br><br>Thus this macro level constraints are enablers for entrepreneurs and ecological actors to target, use, design and manipulate much more dynamic and relevant contextual-constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Design global contextual-constraints based on current disposition of global entrepreneurial state space and attractors.&nbsp;<br></b><br>Self-organizing systems typically evolve towards a state of equilibrium, or an attractor state. Once the system reaches there, the further dynamics and evolution of the system will likely be constrained to remain near such attractor or attractors. Other words, In a complex emergent system, an attractor is a set of states towards which a system will naturally gravitate and remain cycling through. They are islands of stability in a sea of chaos. Thus, even though complex systems are inherently in constant dynamics, they tend to usually settle down into one of a number of possible steady attractor states. These states are called \"attractor basins\". Some examples of attractor states are; Traffic patterns in a city in working days, Distribution of ethnic groups across many multicultural cities, Distribution of political opinions across the different regions of some nation, etc. For any system we can visualize what is called a state space that represents all the possible states that that system might take which is very much related to current distribution of attractor states and basins. \n<br>\n<br>One of the most important challenges of this framework is to identify and design constraints that enable entrepreneurial self-organization towards a global optima, instead of being stuck in local optima. Such constraints should also make it easier for entrepreneurial agents to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if s/he had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree). This is where the idea of designing constraints based on major attractors in global state space seems like the optimum thing we can do.  Unlike sports or established organizations, entrepreneurship has fewer pre-given constraints like environment(football ground), objective goal(score a goal), rules(rules of engagement), players( limited numbers), etc. This means both uncertainty and potentiality are high. But even in this uncertainty, we can identify some stable elements which form part of entrepreneurship state space. \n<br>\n<br>This idea about attractor states was very well articulated(probably inadvertently) by Jeff Bezos in a 2012 interview in which he stressed the need to think in terms of such stable elements in the entrepreneurship ecology. More specifically to him, decisions should be based on what is not going to change in 10 years, than, what is going to change in 10 years. His comments(Bezos, 2012):\n<br>\n<br><b><i>“I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two-- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time....In our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, 'Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,' [or] 'I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly.' Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.” \n<br></i></b>\n<br>\n<br><b>8 stable dimensions\n<br></b>\n<br>As a design choice, I have identified 8 stable dimensions(that can be viewed as attractor states) in entrepreneurial state space as primary enabling constraints. This list of eight is not comprehensive, but just the result of my satisficing effort to design a scaffold (Pendleton and Brown, 2018; Cynefin, 2022a; Wood, Bruner, and Ross, 1976) that enables the entrepreneur to capture the nature of global state space. It is encouraged that entrepreneurs continuously explore the environment for insights and affordances using the scaffold of these 8 constrain dimensions . Further, entrepreneurial agents are encouraged to add, remove, or design, their own constraints that seem necessary at the particular temporal and contextual point. It provides the entrepreneurs, mentors, and other ecosystem actors with metaphorically-- a playground to initiate their own unique constraint-based designs to enable entrepreneurial self-organization. \n<br><br><b>Agent/ The end user/Decision Maker: </b>The human being or the kind. This is the end-user to whom entrepreneurs cater to.\n<br>\n<br><b>Socio-Material Dimension Of The End User/Decision Maker:</b> The society and its dynamics including technology and material aspects in which the agent is embedded.\n<br>\n<br><b>Contextual dimension of End User/ Decision Maker:</b> Every moment of an agent's life represents a different context, which include dimensions like time, situation, role, relationships, etc. In here the context that is specific to entrepreneurship is important.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Real Needs/Wants/Choices:</b> Human needs(or end user needs/decision maker needs) are commonly used to refer to the drivers of people's actions, the motives behind human behavior. Such needs arise out of specific contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Organization to deliver for Needs ( or Startup/ Venture/ Product/ Idea):</b> The fundamental function of an entrepreneurial organization is to cater to human needs. The organization here may be the entrepreneur, a product, or a startup.\n<br>\n<br><b>Networks and Ecosystem disposition: </b>This represents the direct connections and embeddedness of the organization(entrepreneur, a product, or a startup) in an ecosystem or bigger environment. More specifically we can think of it as the disposition of the organization in the ecosystem. E.g. dimensions include Network effect, Platform model, Network of Partners, Network of Customers, etc.   \n<br> \n<br><b>Atmosphere:</b> This includes the general features of the entrepreneurship atmosphere or environment. For e.g. those represented by models like 5 forces, PESTLE, etc. \n<br>\n<br><b>Unconventional Forces:</b> This includes things and forces that are unconventional, unknown or unseen, etc. Corona Virus, New exponential Technologies, Its combinations, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><br>It must also be noted that boundary conditions in complex systems function not as walls, but as “active sites,” like eardrums or membranes(Cilliers, 2002; Juarrero,2013). Thus these 8 dimensions are part of the same state space, hence, encouraged not to see it as separate from the whole. They are interconnected and one in their dynamics. By accepting the inseparable-inter-connectedness it is easy for us to maintain the complexity perspective in mind.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 1\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>7.

The context-free constraints takes a system's components far from equiprobability. It reduces randomness of a system. That means anything and everything cannot happen. It positively biases the probability of something happening and at the same time reduces the probability of something else happening.<br><br>The role of intention as a context free constraint is very interesting example here. According to Juarrero, \"new intention reorganize the earlier state space into a more differentiated and complex set of qualitatively novel options. This means that once an agent formulates a prior intention, every possible behavioral alternative no longer requires consideration; only a partitioned subset does\" Juarrero(2004).&nbsp;<br><br>A very important feature to note here is that every human being comes with a lot of unique types of context-free constraints. An entrepreneur with programming background may have a preference, bias or intention to start a machine learning startup. This is a context free constraint. Thus it may help to understand the difference between context free constraints that are already part of the entrepreneurs disposition and the context free meta-dispositions that I am going to introduce in this part. Both are relevant context-free constraints with real impact on the entrepreneurs probability structure.&nbsp;<br><br>With that understanding, In this part I am adding Meta disposition as a 9th component. Meta dispositions are a kind of context-free constraints that are applicable to the whole of the framework and therefore the users too. While the first 8 exploratory dimensions constitute contextual constraints(Agent, Socio-materiality, Context, Needs, Organization, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional force), this part is about dispositional features of the framework itself. The term disposition according to dictionary means following; \"inherent qualities of mind and character\", \"an inclination or tendency\", \"the way in which something is placed or arranged, especially in relation to other things\", etc.&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Now it looks like;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b>\n<br>1.

Temporal and Contextual factors: Every moment of an agent's life represents a different context, which may include dimensions like time, situation, role, relationships, etc. In here the context that is specific to entrepreneurship is important. The word temporal represents the Kairos time that is 'the right, critical, or opportune moment in relation to a context. \n<br>\n<br>4. Real Human Needs(wants, choice, etc): Human needs are commonly used to refer to the drivers of people's actions, the motives behind human behavior. Such needs arise out of specific contexts.

This include perceiving earth as whole, interconnected, organic, and with no borders or boundaries.

This disposition is about enabling the cultivation of an appropriate type of agency and also to prevent agency hijack by people, processes, models, tools, etc. \n<br>\n<br><b>Explanation \n<br></b>\n<br>Agency is described as an individual’s ability at any given point in time to act independently in order to change the internal or external environment (Bandura, 2001; Campbell, 2009; Hitlin &amp; Elder, 2007). In a complex and uncertain world, we make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. This results in the tendency of the human brain to solve problems in the most simple and straightforward way rather than utilizing a more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This human nature is often exploited by certainty merchants who come up with confident advice and one-size-fits-all models. As a result, people with disciplinary and domain commitments become more committed to disciplinary/domain boundaries and methods aligning perfectly with legacy incentive structures over time. These strong preexisting one-size-fits-all models and other commitments will result in the agent's evolutionary, learning, and adaptive potential being compromised. \n<br>\n<br>The impact of such environmental factors on the human agency is being discussed extensively in the sociological debate on structure vs agency (Hays, 1994). It is an issue of control exercised by the environment against autonomy in determining whether an individual acts as a free agent or in a manner dictated by socio-material structure. A clear understanding of such environmental control must also involve the debate on the effect of human artifacts. According to Bruno Latour (Latour 1996), once designed and introduced into the interactional scene by humans---texts, artifacts, and objects of any kind make sense and have an agency on their own (Caronia and Mortari, 2015). The entrepreneurial implication is that artifacts and existing models like Lean startup, business plan, etc, are that, if used as a prescriptive model will have a take-over-effect on the entrepreneur's agency.  They make a significant difference in the way we see and act in the world. We can design, create or use them, but in a way, they also design, create or use us. We are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>This framework doesn't have any one-size-fits-all solution for the agency problem. Instead, it further has the following pointers: \n<br>\n<br>To the disposition, an entrepreneur must be capable of behaving adaptively, freely, and effectively in a given situation, exercising his agency to the fullest. Agency here doesn't mean the ability to agenda-setting or control things, but is a catalyst for self-organization. This is to use to the best the evolutionary potential of the present. This means considering other agencies, co-adaptive potential, co-evolutionary potential, path-dependence, etc. It is an attempt to make the entrepreneur aware of agency and its importance in complex domains where ground realities change rapidly. It enables and reminds the agent of its agency. It nudges or biases the entrepreneur to deal with the agency problem and agency exercise. So it is up to the entrepreneur alone to find solutions to his problems. \n<br>\n<br>For the framework, I propose the following understanding about agency; \n<br>\n<br>1. Agency here means relational agency that sees the world as a network of interacting agencies rather than a collection of independent objects subjected to external forces (Heylighen, 2022).\n<br>\n<br>2. Agency is thus not only distributed across actors (Garud and Karnøe, 2005) but it is embedded as well (Garud and Karnøe, 2003). I.e. Actors become embedded in paths that they try to shape in real time.\n<br>\n<br>3. Such agency has a kind of awareness(connection, entanglement) of its(his/her) own Intention(attractor), Phase space disposition, Adjacent possible. \n<br>\n<br>4. Such agency has a kind of awareness(connection, entanglement) of the Intention(attractor) of other systems/agents, Phase space disposition of other systems/agents, Adjacent-possible of other systems/agents.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 1\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>Disposition 2: Diversity; Enabling cultivation of diversity(variation)</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"sign mbr-iconfont mbri-arrow-down\"></span>\n                                </a>\n\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse2\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>The objective of the disposition \n<br></b>\n<br>This disposition is about enabling cultivation of diversity. More specifically, a diversity that is specific to entrepreneurship ecology.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br><b>Explanation&nbsp;<br></b><br>As I have previously discussed, it is important to adopt a context-specific ecological worldview which involves a continuous effort to capture the true ecological reality in its dynamics. I have previously examined how this is different from the Single model, Multi-Model, Cognitive-Diversity and Holistic diversity view points. The ecological world view of the framework includes a diversity approach that is not just inclusive of all the above views, but also, of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, nonlinear interaction, etc. This view thus promotes;<br><br><b>* Cognitive diversity<br>* General diversity<br>* Diversity in Its dynamics(elements of diversity will interact, mutate, evolve and die)<br>* Diversity that is uniquely in relation to the entrepreneurial agent in question</b><br><br>This framework provides enabling constraints that are context-specific to entrepreneurship, and the entrepreneur. It enables diversity exploration towards context-specific entrepreneurial dimensions, i.e. Agent, Socio-materiality, Contextual Factors, Network and ecosystem disposition, Atmosphere, and Unconventional forces. These constraints limit entrepreneur's infinity of options, channel his or her energy and create new affordances for diversity exploration. These are unique for every entrepreneur.<br><br><b>Importance of diversity<br></b><br>According to Paul Cilliers(2002), Complex systems are constrained, they have an organized structure, but within those constraints, the system has to diversify maximally in order to thrive. Thus, In this section, I am introducing the dispositional element of diversity to enable the cultivation of diversity. Evidence on the importance of diversity is overwhelming and can be found in many different disciplines. It is viewed as advantageous because it can help a system to consistently reach and sustain desirable settings for a single system property by providing multiple distinct paths to a particular state (Whitacre and Bender,2010).<br><br>When considering biological evolution, genetic diversity helps maintain the health of a population by including alleles that may be valuable in resisting diseases and other stresses. When and If the environment changes, a population that has a higher variability of alleles will be better able to evolve to adapt to the new environment. Thus genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more likely that individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. Further, biological diversity is essential in the self-organizing ability of complex adaptive systems(Levin, 1999) both in terms of absorbing disturbance and in regenerating and re-organizing the system following disturbance(Folke,2006). In social systems, the success of the human species also has a lot to do with diversity. Many animals exhibit social learning and behavioral traditions, but, human culture appears unique in that it is cumulative, i.e. human cultural traits increase in diversity and complexity over time (Legare, 2017). <br><br>The importance of diversity was also demonstrated in various domains and scientific studies. Some examples are; Micro diversity (Allen, 1976; 1994; Allen and Jacqueline, 1987) ), Functional redundancy (Naeem 1998, Petchey et al. 2007), Response diversity (Elmqvist et al., 2003), Diversity in Social-ecological systems (Ellis 2000; Low et al. 2003), Portfolio theory in economics and biodiversity management (Schindler et al, 2010), Problem-solving in decision making (Hong and Page, 2004, 2001), Business Performance (Kochan et al, 2003), Cultural diversity (Ely and Thomas, 2001), Experiential diversity (Weigelt and Sarkar, 2009; Spanjer and Witteloostuijn, 2017), Ensemble models (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; Sagi and Rokach, 2018; Anderson,1996), Cognitive diversity (Mello and Rentsch, 2015; Olson et al, 2007), etc. <br><br><br><b>HOW IT WORKS </b><b><br></b>&nbsp;<br>Since we have already discussed the 8 context-sensitive dimensions, here we are using those dimensions or constraints to shape our exploration for diversity in its dynamics&nbsp;<br><br>The symbol (+) depicted in the following part represents enablers for adding and learning more repertoires of diversity in its dynamics. This learning is a dynamic, non-linear and continues process.&nbsp;<br><br>+ <br>Agent+ <br>+ <br>Socio-materiality + <br>+ <br>Contextual Factors+ <br>+ <br>Needs, Wants and choices:+ <br>+ <br>Organization and Delivery system: + <br>+ <br>Network and ecosystem dependencies: + <br>+ <br>Atmosphere:+ <br>+ <br>Unconventional forces:+ <br>+ <br>Thatva:+ <br>+ <br><br><b>Cognitive diversity(CD) that includes following cognitive repertoires(Scott Page); <br></b><br>Information Diversity(data, facts), Knowledge Diversity(expertise and knowledge in a domain), Heuristics Diversity(simple rules of them, techniques), Representations Diversity(perspectives on the situation), Mental model Diversity(simplified) simplify complex ideas. <br><br><b>Diversity in general(DG) means; <br></b><br>Skill Diversity, Functional Diversity, People Diversity(not just cognitive, but functional, or based on potential), Network Diversity, Information source Diversity, Relational-expertise Diversity, Institutional Diversity, Cultural Diversity, Location Diversity, Specialization Diversity, Artifact Diversity, Tool Diversity, etc. <br><br><br><b>Dynamics and Evolution <br></b><br>The diversity or elements of variation in an entrepreneurial ecosystem is constantly in interaction, dynamics, and evolution. Every part is connected to every other part and they exchange energy and information. This makes it important to be in a continuous exploration mode. Thus, diversity must be approached with the view that the real world has complexity, it is dynamic, it is always evolving, it is connected, in it, elements interact with each other. Practically this means that ideas will evolve, tools will become useless, people will die or move on, things and forces will mutate together to form unknowns and incomprehensible things. <br><br>This must also accommodate exploration of more types of diversity which is missing from the above list. There can also be opposing and contradictory diversity too.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>Disposition 3: Enskilment; Ecological-Anthropological way to learn and explore the world&nbsp;</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"sign mbr-iconfont mbri-arrow-down\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>The objective of the disposition <br></b><br>Here I will introduce the Ecological-Anthropological idea of enskilment as a preferred way to explore, learn and navigate the entrepreneurial environment. This approach views learning as inseparable from doing and place. I will discuss four ‘threads’ of enskilment, i.e. Taskscape, Wayfinding, Guided attention, Storytelling (Ingold, 2000; Prins and Wattchow, 2020; Woods et al, 2020; Woods et al, 2021). Each of these 4 components are entangled to support enskilment. The taskscape is viewed as the entrepreneurship environment; Guided attention can be viewed as the role played by more knowledgeable others like educators, mentors, coaches, etc;&nbsp; Wayfinding can viewed as an actively self-organizing and self-regulating entrepreneur, or venture (Adapted from Woods et al, 2021)<br><br><b>Enskilment</b><br><br>Social anthropologists have particularly shown a great interest in understanding how people learn the everyday tasks of life.  This includes learning crafts, occupation, navigation, hunting, building, toolmaking, etc. Social anthropologist Tim Ingold calls such learning a process of enskilment that is inseparable from doing and place (Ingold, 2000; Prins and Wattchow, 2020; Woods et al, 2020; Woods et al, 2021). <br><br>According to Ingold (2000), enskilemnt is \"understanding in practice”. . . in which learning is inseparable from doing, and in which both are embedded in the context of a practical engagement in the world’ (Ingold, 2000, p. 416). To be enskiled thus is to be skilful and knowledgeable at a particular thing in a particular setting. It refers to the deep practical know-how that skilled people seem to possess in relation to their occupation and location. In enskilement, the unit of analysis is not the autonomous individual who is separated from the social world by the surface of the body or a natural being who passively internalizes the mental scripts of the cultural environment, but rather the whole person in action, acting within the contexts of that activity\" (Pálsson, 1994).<br><br>Thus, becoming enskiled cannot occur separately, in isolation from context or experience, as it grows in the messiness of the noisy ‘real-world’. Enskilment thus can be viewed as a deep, tacit, and practical knowledge—a type of local ‘know how’ or ‘knack’ that progressively emerges as an individual becomes intimately familiar with a task and surrounding(Woods et al, 2021). In enskilment, knowledge should not be confused as being proceduralised, manifested via the storage of prescriptive rules that are presumed to enable the automatization of movement. Rather, from an enskilment perspective, knowledge is understood as a progressive attunement of one’s perceptual system toward the detection of information in the environment of use for regulating action (Woods et al, 2021).<br><br><b>Four key components of enskilment are Taskscape, Wayfinding, Guided attention, Storytelling. <br></b><br><b>Taskscape</b><br><br>Taskscape is the phenomenon of people acting in accordance with dwelling in the place where they live. According to  Ingold, people become enskilled by dwelling within various places—meaning that learning about a place is inseparable from being in a place.  It is by dwelling that people learn to become familiar with a place’s features, which includes the tasks of other inhabitants that “make up the pattern of activity of a community” (Ingold, 2000; p. 325).  From this dwelling perspective, a task can be understood as a practical, goal-directed activity undertaken by an individual interacting with an environment. So, then, the taskscape is the “entire ensemble of tasks in their mutual interlocking” (Ingold, 2000; p. 195). The idea of mutual interlocking emphasizes that tasks are never completed in isolation, but only exist in an enmeshment of people interacting with each other and a performance environment. Therefore, the taskscape ‘exists only so long as people are actually engaged in the activities’ (Ingold, 2000, p. 197) of life. <br><br>In the case of entrepreneurship, taskscape is the unique performance environment in which a particular entrepreneur is embedded. Entrepreneurs become enskilled by dwelling within the places. This means learning about a place is inseparable from being in a place. Remember that learning here should not be equated to learning for exams or rote memorization, but to explore and learn to act in the world. It is only by a dwelling that entrepreneurs learn to become familiar with the features of the place, which most significantly includes the tasks of other inhabitants.&nbsp;That manifests into an inseparable, entangled, embodied, embedded, enactive and extended kind of learning and exploring. The entrepreneurial taskscape is thus the “entire ensemble of tasks in their mutual interlocking”. <br><br><b>Wayfinding</b><br><br>Wayfinding (Ingold, 2000) is best described as an experiential and narrative way of moving through a landscape as one continues to learn it. It is the process of embarking upon a purposeful, intentional, and self-regulated journey that takes an individual from an intended region in one landscape to another. This process is facilitated through an individual’s capacity to utilise temporally structured, functional actions embedded within a particular environmental niche.  It requires ‘long-term attunement and attentiveness’ (Tyrrell, 2006, p. 225) to a place that includes an intricate knowledge of its physical features, weather, cultural and social happenings and how it changes through time (Ingold, 2000; Tyrrell, 2006), rather than a static two-dimensional and symbolic rendering on a map or chart.  More than that, it involves knowing ‘how one may reach it, or reach other places from it’ (Ingold, 2000, p. 238; Prins and Wattchow, 2020). It is much more than the mere familiarity of a landscape on how one can find their way without a map. <br><br>The dynamics of wayfinding would require the entrepreneur to develop an intimate knowledge of a taskscape’s informational constraints such as socio-material features, climate, socio-cultural norms, rules, and local history. It also requires an understanding of how such things enmesh to shape the entrepreneur's perceptions and actions through an evolving long-term attunement and attentiveness to various opportunities for environmental interaction.<br><br><b>Guided attention<br></b><br>Guided attention is another most important dimension of enskillemnnt which positions a more knowledgeable other or others as agents who guide the attention of the wayfinding learner. This is the role played by coaches, educators, mentors, etc in the entrepreneurship domain. According to Ingold (2017), “The task of the educator, then, is not to explicate knowledge for the benefit of those who are assumed, by default, to be ignorant, but to provide inspiration, guidance, and criticism in the exemplary pursuit of truth\".  This approach to education is ‘hands-on, not in the hard sense of instructing, but in the soft sense of guiding—guiding one’s attention toward the direct perception of things that may otherwise be cloaked to them by watching, listening, or feeling (Woods et al, 2021). <br><br>Guiding an entrepreneur’s attention to informational properties that support performance in the taskscape can take shape in a variety of ways.  According to Prins and Wattchow(2020), guiding a performer's attention \"relies upon anticipating and knowing what to do and when to do it in any given context and with any learner. This relates not only to the task but also the complex array of what the learner needs at that particular moment in the taskscape. If the pedagogic moment is fulfilled, the learner’s attention is drawn to the right thing—at the right time—in the right place—in the right way\"<br><br><b>Place-based Storytelling<br></b><br>This is about taskscape based or place-based stories and storytelling. Storied and narrative knowing is a central component of land-centric knowledge systems (Raffan, 1992; Ingold, 2000; Prins and Wattchow, 2020).  Stories in the enskilemnt perspective are not just a representation or an account of what has happened but rather, a continual communication that is also a way humans make sense of their world.  With this account Ingold (2000) states: \"I don’t believe, however, that their purpose is a representational one. Telling a story is not like weaving a tapestry to cover up the world or, as in an over worn anthropological metaphor, to ‘clothe it with meaning’. Far from dressing up a plain reality with layers of metaphor, or representing it, map like, in the imagination, songs, stories and designs serve to conduct the attention of performers into the world, deeper and deeper, as one proceeds from outward appearances to an ever more poetic involvement\". (p. 56)<br><br>When learning how to wayfind, an entrepreneur must pay careful attention to the many stories told in situ as well as direct experience that place many times for themselves (Ingold, 2000; Tyrrell, 2006).  Stories help the entrepreneur guide attentiveness, and attentiveness leads to becoming more deeply enskiled in the taskscape. <br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 3\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>Disposition 4: Affordances, Ecological Validity and 4E</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"sign mbr-iconfont mbri-arrow-down\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse4\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>The objective of the disposition \n<br></b>\n<br>Here I will introduce the concept of Affordance. I will discuss why affordance as a concept can be used to check the ecological validity of a model, or education program, etc.&nbsp; This will help us to promote ecological validity of ideas, models, etc., and to prevent ecologically invalid ideas from taking over too much time, space and resources. Here I will also discuss the importance of 4E cognition perspective while thinking about contextual and ecological dimentsion of entrepreneurship<br>\n<br><b>Explanation \n</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Affordances and Ecological validity<br></b><br>The concept of ecological validity was originally proposed by Egon Brunswik(1956). At a later point, Ulric Neisser(1967) used the concept of ecological validity to refer to the external validity of research design.&nbsp;Since then researchers have generally used the label to refer to external validity. For the ESOLoop framework, ecological validity is adopted as a simple rule or heuristics to think about the validity of ideas used. This is to prioritize the context-dependent realities of the entrepreneur (Trueblood et al, 2013; Hutchins and Klausen, 1996). In other words, we must prioritize to view the world with an ecological perspective where the agent is entangled in a deep relationship with the environment. <br><br>The framework adopts the concept of affordances as a useful tool to enact ecological validity. The concept of affordance was developed by J.J Gibson(1977) to describe the interactions between a goal-oriented actor and an object in the environment in terms of what it “affords” the actor, or in other words in terms of action possibilities for meeting the actor’s goal. <br><br>According to Gibson(1979/2014), environmental properties provide affordances for each individual. They are not intrinsic properties of the object. Rather, affordances emerge from the relationship between the object and the actor with which it is interacting. Further, the perception of affordances depends on one’s needs in the specific situation at hand as well as on the ultimate aim of the action.  <br><br>With learning, experience, and knowledge, entrepreneurs can become attuned to the perceptual variables of various affordances available in a taskscape. At a given point, entrepreneurs are provided with a manifold of action possibilities, which are uniquely relative to the entrepreneur. Due to these differences in the affordances available for different entrepreneurs, the opportunities for action in a taskscape differ between people, problems, and contexts. Because affordance is relative to each entrepreneur, each requires their own unique path of enskillment. Entrepreneurs need to learn and explore the taskscape in a way to get more and more attuned to available desired affordances that are functional for entrepreneurial performance. The informational constraints like guided attention and place-based storytelling, etc, will enable the entrepreneurs to perceive information for affordances and couple their actions to key information sources within specific taskscapes at the opportune time.  <br><br>Ultimately the effect of an intervention, mentorship, education, policy, etc on entrepreneurial activity or learning can only be understood by what affordances it has provided the entrepreneur.  <br><br><br><b>Contextualizing Cognition for affordances with 4E<br></b><br>The embodied, embedded, enactive (Varela et al., 1992), and extended (Clark and Chalmers, 1998) perspectives are useful ways to act on contextualizing entrepreneurship. The foundation of traditional cognitive science used to be the representational(&amp; computational) model of cognition. According to this model, cognition is a kind of information processing that consists of the syntactically driven manipulation of representational mental structures. In particular, cognitive processes were said to be computations over mental representations that are symbolic in nature. (Newen et al, 2018 ). To me, this perspective is incomplete and incapable of giving practical insights without being embedded in the context.<br><br>Here I am making an effort to separate this simplistic understanding of cognition with 4E cognition(embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended). 4E is a grounded and necessary view of cognition that is more suited for the adaptive and emergent dimensions of entrepreneurship. This distinction is not made to reduce the significance of any perspectives or to compartmentalize the obviously porous and enmeshed relation, but to enable the facilitation of actionable knowledge and make knowledge actionable/usable for the entrepreneurial agent. This is made specially in acknowledgment of the contextually divorced and useless cliche advice which is extremely prevalent in the global entrepreneurship thinking space.<br><br>The central argument of 4E is that cognition does not occur exclusively inside the head, but is embodied, embedded, enacted, or extended by way of extra-cranial processes and structures (Rowlands 2010). Thus, entrepreneurial cognition is embodied in that cognitive properties and performances crucially depend on facts about his embodiment (Clark, 1999; Haugeland, 1993). Embodied cognition is when cognition is deeply dependent upon features of the physical body of an agent, that is when aspects of the entrepreneurial agent's body beyond the brain play a significant role in cognitive processing. Structural limitations, emotions, feelings, movement, perception, etc. are significant aspects of this embodiment.<br><br>Entrepreneurial Cognition is embedded in that cognitive properties and performances can crucially depend on facts about his relationship to the surrounding environment (Haugeland, 1993; Huebner, 2013). Embedded cognition stresses the idea of the situated nature of cognition. It posits that cognition is inseparable and situated in social, cultural, and physical contexts.<br><br>Entrepreneurial cognition is enactive (Di Paolo and Thompson, 2014), which means dependent on activities in pursuit of the creation of artifact(product, venture, etc). The Enactive (Rietveld, et al, 2018) dimension argues that cognition arises through a dynamic interaction between an acting organism and its environment. From this perspective cognition and environment are inseparable, and learning is drawn from the interaction between learner and environment. Finally, Entrepreneurial cognition can be extended (Clark and Chalmers, 1998) by using material vehicles beyond the boundaries of the cognizing organism. Entrepreneurs use their networks(other people) and artifacts(tools, money, etc) to affect the extension of their cognition.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 4\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">\n                                   <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>Disposition 5: Adaptiveness: Adaptiveness of the entrepreneur to dynamics of environment&nbsp;</b></h6>\n                                        <span class=\"mbr-iconfont mobi-mbri-arrow-down mobi-mbri\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse5\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>The objective of the disposition \n<br></b>\n<br>This part stress the adaptiveness of the individual to environment. The primary objective here is to enable more adaptiveness to the framework, the using entrepreneur and other stakeholders in accordance with the novel emergent realities. It is not about prescribing ways of improving adaptiveness, but to enabling the entrepreneurs to find what it means to be adaptive in h(is/er) own context. \n<br>\n<br><b>Explanation&nbsp;</b><br><br>Terms like expertise, skill acquisition, competence, etc, often comes with an individualistic bend. This is clearly visible in disciplines like entrepreneurship, psychology,  philosophy, education, movement science and performance development, etc. In cognitive psychology it goes further extremes to the establishment of an internal state or representation of an act which is believed to be acquired as a result of learning and task experience. Following the suggestion by Araújo and Davids (2011) I propose that an ecological perspective to entrepreneurship should stress more on adaptive functional relationship between an organism and its environment, thus avoid the inherent organismic asymmetry that comes with possessive individualistic framing like skill acquisition. Here I will discuss what it means to be adaptive and what are dimensions of adaptation that are relevant.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>A complex system is adaptive when heterogeneous components react differently to outside influences, thus continually modifying the system and allowing it to adapt to altered conditions (Messier et al, 2016). In biology, adaptation primarily involves the dynamic evolutionary process that fits organisms to their environment, enhancing their evolutionary fitness. Adaptation is important because it makes a system better and able to sustain itself. This is because nature and evolution do not favor stability and equilibrium: instead, natural processes select for resilience and adaptability (Juarrero, 2015). \n<br>\n<br>In order to adapt to a dynamic environment, a complex system needs a sufficiently large variety(diversity) of possible states to cope with likely perturbations. Further given this variety(diversity), the most adequate configurations are selected according to their fitness, either by the environment or by subsystems that have already adapted to the environment at an earlier stage (Heylighen 2001). The same opinion on the relationship between diversity(variation) and adaptation is shared by the Constraints-led approach (Renshaw et al, 2019), according to which, \"Skill adaptation implies that performance goals can still be achieved, as athletes learn to vary their actions according to the information that emerges in unpredictable performance contexts. Adaptation provides a functional relationship between stability (i.e. persistent behaviors) and flexibility (i.e. variable behaviors) during performance. Highly skilled performance is characterized by stable and reproducible movement patterns, which are consistent over time, resistant to perturbations.\" \n<br>\n<br><b>The central questions \n<br></b>\n<br>The central questions of adaptive dimension are, how to be adaptive? how to be co-adaptive? and 'how to adapt the knowledge, skill, resources, etc, to best suit the ever-changing, ever dynamic entrepreneurial contexts? What is preventing the functional adaptation from taking place.\n<br>\n<br>I am calling this part the adaptive dimension because everything we learned and understood previously needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial contextual reality in pursuit of entrepreneurial self-organization. This can be represented by interactive, interrelated, and contextually unique emergence of the 4 dimensions--Agent, Task, Artifact, Environment.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 5\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>Disposition 6: Evolvability: Enable evolvability to entrepreneur and the framework&nbsp;</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"mbr-iconfont mobi-mbri-arrow-down mobi-mbri\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse6\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>The objective of the disposition \n<br></b>\n<br>Since I have discussed diversity and adaptiveness, two qualities necessary for the self-organizing complex adaptive system, this part is about the overarching concept of system evolution and how we can enable evolvability as a tatva(disposition). \n<br>\n<br><b>Explanation\n</b><br>\n<br>Evolution is a fundamental feature of nature, biology, and human social life. In comparison to biological evolution, the human social system is capable of adapting to change at a faster rate. It is particularly significant in the case of entrepreneurship in that entrepreneurs often act as catalysts of social evolution and also are affected by the smallest of changes in the environment. One of the major sources of weakness in existing entrepreneurship models is the lack of evolvability. Once proposed and written down the model never changes. Even with this vulnerability, most ideas and models in the entrepreneurship domain are self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it gives a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity. This framework accepts its own possible weaknesses and contingencies. Everything about this model can be changed and designed to suit the idiosyncrasy of the user and the complexity of the context. Evolvability in this framework means you can learn, unlearn, add, subtract, design, create, combine, remix, recombine and customize solutions to suit the ever-changing dynamics of idiosyncratic and contextual needs. In other words,\"evolving to greater evolvability\" (Juarrero, 2015) is the goal here. Here also, the practical agenda is not about prescribing ways of improving evolvability, but to enable the entrepreneurs to find what it means to be evolvable in his or her own context.<br><br>Enabling evolvability could mean being attuned to various levels of evolvability like Micro, Mezzo, Macro and Meta. The nature of these levels is context-dependent and will change according to the unit of observation(an atom can be micro in one analysis, and macro in another). In entrepreneurship, Micro could mean intention, cognition, local interaction, etc. Mezzo could mean intermediate level interaction co-evolution and adaptation with institutions like local government, VCs, accelerators, businesses, etc. Marco could mean interaction, co-evolution, and adaptation with the macro structures, policy, international politics, markets, crisis, etc. Meta level means thinking, acting, and designing about and for better evolvability. \n<br><b><br></b>A richer understanding of the evolvability dimension may include the interactive, interrelated, and contextually unique co-evolution of the entrepreneurial Agent, Artifact, and Environment. Selden &amp; Fletcher(2015) depicted this aspect in their non-linear model of artifacts as an emergent hierarchical system with 6 levels. Level 1 includes an entrepreneurial sense-making subsystem in the form of a business idea (artifact), which is functional to interaction in entrepreneur–stakeholder subsystems. Level 2 includes the emergence of an operational business model (artifact). At Level 3, the operational business model created at Level 2 is functional to the emergence of firm capabilities (artifacts) and marketable commodities (artifacts) in the entrepreneurial firm subsystem. At level 4 the marketing of a commodity is functional to the emergence for either replicating existing business, product concepts, etc, Or innovative and breaking away from existing knowledge. At level 5 this market system becomes functional to the formation of firm clusters and regional business relationships. At Level 6 the previous levels become functional to the wider societal emergence of entrepreneurial culture, discourse, and practices. This co-emergence of Agent, Artifact, and Environment necessitates the evolution of strategy and action which suites such emergence. \n<br>\n<br><b><br></b><br><b>Pro-evolvability features to cultivate; These are some of the features that are foundational to evolvability: \n<br></b>\n<br>1.

The disturbance must not be so big to destroy the system itself. \n<br>\n<br>5. Avoid rigid constraints and prescriptions: Rigidity will prevent evolvability, and it is not ecologically grounded. A good example is the list of prescriptive models in entrepreneurship. \n<br>\n<br>6. Framework as a scaffold: Scaffolding is a temporary structure used to support the development of a structure. It is not meant to be permanent. Existing prescriptive models and frameworks propose permanent structures that end up being inflexible. This framework is not designed as a permanent structure but as an impermanent scaffold that enables emergence (Pendleton and Brown, 2018; Cynefin, 2022a). \n<br>\n<br>7. Learning/Learnability: Evolution and evolvability manifest itself in the individual and social domain mostly by learning(cognitive, social, ecological, or cumulative culture). This is why learnability is important. Learnability could mean; learning to learn better and develop the ability to progressively cultivate more and more capabilities to become better, more complex learners.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n</section>",

This provides the entrepreneurs with the ability to visualize the entire state space which includes&nbsp;both Context-Sensitive and Context-Free constraints. It facilitates&nbsp;better sense-making about functional and dysfunctional context-free constraints that limits or enables effective exploration of entrepreneurial taskscape. Note that the acronym ASTRONAUT should be viewed just as a&nbsp;scaffold and not as a permanent&nbsp;structure that ends up being a decoy of the real world.&nbsp;</b><br><br><b> Now it looks like the following: \n<br></b>\n<br><b>The acronym \"ASTRONAUT\" represents;&nbsp;<br></b><br>A.

Tattva(Meta-Disposition or Context-Free Constraints)<br><br><b>ASTRONAUT as a term representing the metaphor of Overview Effect experienced by astronauts \n<br></b>\n<br>The acronym ASTRONAUT here is inspired by the “Overview Effect\", a concept developed by Frank White(1998), indicating the ability to see the big picture like an Astronaut. “Overview Effect\" is a shift in awareness that happens to astronauts while they are in space, often while viewing the Earth. This include perceiving earth as whole, interconnected, organic, and with no borders or boundaries. It is also the aim of the framework to create such an awareness shift, to make it easier for users to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if they has to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree).&nbsp;<br><br><b>In elaboration the ASTRONAUT will be: <br></b><br><b>A. Agent/ The end user/Decision Maker:</b> The human being or the kind. This is the end-user to whom entrepreneurs cater to.<br><br><b>S. Socio-Material Dimension Of The End User/Decision Maker:</b>&nbsp;The society and its dynamics including technology and material aspects in which the agent is embedded.<br><br><b>T. Temporal and Contextual dimension of End User/Decision Maker:</b>&nbsp;Every moment of an agent's life represents a different context, which include dimensions like time, situation, role, relationships, etc. In here the context that is specific to entrepreneurship is important. The word temporal represents the Kairos time that is 'the right, critical, or opportune moment in relation to a context.<br> <br><b>R. Real Needs/Wants/Choices of end user/Decision Maker:&nbsp;</b>Human needs(or end user needs) are commonly used to refer to the drivers of people's actions, the motives behind human behavior. Such needs arise out of specific contexts. Even though I have changed the term to fit the acronym ASTRONAUT, It represents a deeper probe into the very nature of human needs and its emergent representations like wants, choices, etc. <br><br><b>O. Organization to deliver for R ( or Startup/ Venture/ Product/ Idea):</b>&nbsp;The fundamental function of an entrepreneurial organization is to cater to human needs. The organization here may be the entrepreneur, a product, or a startup.<br><br><b>N.  Networks and Ecosystem disposition:</b> This represents the direct connections and embeddedness of the organization(entrepreneur, a product, or a startup) in an ecosystem or bigger environment. More specifically we cab think of it as the disposition of the organization in the ecosystem.E.g. dimensions include Network effect, Platform model, Partners, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A.

If the world view is reductionist or simplistic, ignoring important unknowns, the design will reflect this weakness. As discussed previously, entrepreneurship is a naturally complex system, and it is necessary to study entrepreneurial phenomena by applying the frame of complexity science (McKelvey, 2004). Despite this reality, most entrepreneurship models and perspectives are reductionist in their origin, prescription, or omission. To solve this weakness this framework adopts an ecological world view, i.e a complex, dynamic, connected, and evolving ecology. <br><br>In order to understand the ecological view, let's first go through some of the existing world views or alternatives. After that, I will introduce the ecological view to show how it is different from other world views. <br><br><b>1. Single Model world view:</b> This is the world view based on a single model, tool, or method which assumes superiority over all others. This can be equated to what Charlie Munger(1994)calls, “Man with a Hammer” syndrome, which is the idea that if an individual has only one tool or model(e.g. hammer), he'll approach all of his problems with the same solution, i.e. a hammer. For a man with a hammer, everything around him will seem like a nail. Most models in entrepreneurship come under this category. They are proposed as solutions for the problems of the existing one and are pitched as better than the previous one. E.g. Lean startup (Blank, 2013; Ries, 2011) Vs Business planning, Theory-based view (Felin et al, 2020) vs Lean, etc. Using the antecedent as a frame to marginally improve the model is also the standard practice. <br><br><b>2. Multiple-Model Ensembles: </b>This world view suggests the complementary use of multiple models or methods. This is the same idea as suggested by Scott Page(2018) and the ensemble forecasting model (Leutbecher and Palmer, 2008) used in weather prediction. In entrepreneurship, multiple model world view can be found in many scholarly works. For e.g. Sarasvathy(2001)stressed the importance of both effectuation and causation. Mansoori and Lackéus(2019) suggested using multiple methods complementing each other. This world view is by default inclusive of the previous one. <br><br><b>3. Cognitive-Diversity world view:</b> This world view suggests using not only formal models or methods but all kinds of cognitive diversity. E.g. Models, methods, theories, heuristics, etc. Scott Page defines Cognitive Diversity as “Differences in information, knowledge, representations, mental models, and heuristic, to better outcomes on specific tasks such as problem-solving, predicting, and innovating (Page, 2017,14-15)\". To me, the weakness of this view is in its cognitive reductionism. Even though this world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones, any cognitive alone worldview can be criticized for lack of ecological basis (Gibson, 1979; Varela et al., 1991; Clark, 1997). <br><br><br><b>4. Holistic Diversity worldview:</b> Apart from cognitive diversity, Page(2017) also talks about identity diversity, i.e. the differences in race, gender, age, physical capabilities, and sexual orientation. There are other frames to view diversities like; Biodiversity, which can be defined as variety in all forms of life—from genes to species to ecosystems (Wood, 1997); Cultural diversity, which can be defined as differences, such as in language, religion, dress and moral codes that exist between people according to race and ethnicity (Leveson et al, 2009; Kossek and Zonia, 1993). Tool diversity suggesting for the use of multiple tools for the same task to increase output accuracy by reducing systematic errors (Song et al, 2018). Artifact diversity refers to the number of different classes of artifacts and their relative proportions (Lyman and O'Brien, 2000). In short, this world view suggests the existence of not only Cognitive-Diversity but also, all other kinds of diversity, i.e. diversity in people, biology, identity, networks, information sources, relational-expertise, institutions, culture, location, specialization, artifacts, tools, etc. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. <br><br><br><b>5. Ecological View or Deep ecology view:</b> This includes a continuous effort to capture the true ecological reality in its dynamics. In addition to the previously listed holistic diversity, this view is inclusive of realities like complexity, dynamics, evolution, connectedness, interaction, etc. Complexity involves features and interactive dynamics as in a complex adaptive system. The idea of evolution suggests that existing elements interact, evolve, co-evolve into new diversities, variations, etc. It must also involve cumulative cultural evolution(and intelligence) as proposed by human cultural evolution studies. In addition, an ecology is connected, hence no clear local-global separation is possible. This is particularly significant in human social ecology. Finally, the ecological view involves the use of contextualized sense-making that suggests that every human context is an emergent property and hence each context has unique types of characters. This world view is by default inclusive of all the previous ones. <br><br><br><b>The framework's worldview: 3 parts <br></b><br><b>1. Deep ecology (Arne Naess, 1973; Capra, 1996) <br></b><br>A practical or working definition of ecology can change with the unit of observation, domains or problems, etc. Thus, ecology can be defined in a biological perspective as the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and their environment, while for e.g. if we are looking at the disease ecology, it can be defined as the ecological study of host-pathogen interactions within the context of their environment and evolution (Kilpatrick and Altizer, 2010). Similarly, the term social ecology in the context of child health and well-being would mean a nested arrangement of family, school, neighborhood, and community contexts in which children grow up (Earls and Carlson, 2001). Likewise, information ecology may mean the interaction and co-evolution of technologies, human beings and the social environment (Pekkarinen et al, 2020). Further, ecology can also be of a subdomain(problem or topic), like for e.g. the phenomena of human suffering which comes under mental health. Thus, “ecology” can refer to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him or her (Jadhav, 2015). <br><br>With this practical understanding, this framework operates in the entrepreneurial ecology, where multiple agents, institutions, artifacts, problems, etc, interact with each other to form a complex adaptive interdependent system that emerges in the human socio-cognitive-material space. Even though the framework(and by implication the users of the framework) operates primarily in the entrepreneurial ecology, the world view it beholds is \"deep ecology\". This means, entrepreneurial ecology is part of deep ecology and everything is connected to everything else. <br><br>The philosophical school of deep ecology was founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess(1973). He developed the concept by distinguishing it with what he calls shallow ecology, which is human-centered. Shallow ecology \"views humans as above or outside of nature, as the source of all value, and ascribes only instrumental, or \"use,\" value to nature. Deep ecology does not separate humans--or anything else-from the natural environment. It sees the world not as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. Deep ecology recognizes the intrinsic value of all living beings and views humans as just one particular strand in the web of life\"(Capra, 1996). <br><br>According to Capra(1996, p.3), the ecological worldview grew out of an awareness that contemporary problems cannot be understood in isolation. They are systemic problems, which means that they are interconnected and interdependent. He uses the term ‘deep ecology’ to highlight the inescapable connections and mutual influences among the human, natural, physical, and constructed environments implicit in this view of reality (Mitchell and Sackney, 2011, p.2). Further, the deep ecological perspective can be viewed as a perspective to ecological complexity that involves properties like holistic interconnection, interdependence, heterogeneous agents, non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, emergent property, self-organization, dynamics of evolution, attractor behavior, power Laws, open exchange or energy and information with their environment, etc. <br><br><br><b>2. Self Organization <br></b><br>The second important part of this worldview is Self-organisation. This is about seeing entrepreneurs, industries, economies, etc as self-organizing systems. As discussed in part 1, It refers to the emergence of stable patterns through autonomous and self-reinforcing dynamics at the micro-level (Kauffman, 1995; Anzola et al., 2017). It is a bottom-up process where complex organization emerges at multiple levels from the interaction of lower-level entities. In self-organization, the final product is the result of nonlinear interactions rather than planning and micro design, and it cannot be known beforehand.  <br><br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(1) where I will introduce the theory of effectual self-organization <br><br><b>3. Constraints <br></b><br>Self-organization happens under various constraints. Constraints in a general sense may be taken as restrictive. But it is important to understand that constraints are enabling too. Order in human life is primarily created through constraints. \"It is not something which merely limits possibilities, constraints are also enabling. By eliminating certain possibilities, others are introduced” (Cilliers, 2001). <br><br>According to Lili Gatlin(1971), In a system, the probability that something will happen vs. something else happening is due to constraints. E.g. Our skeleton system constraints self-organization so that we get a humanly shaped body. Scholars like Kauffman(1993) also emphasized this role of constraints on the direction of evolution caused by self-organization. <br><br>This idea will be expanded in part 2(ll) where I will introduce two types of constraints(context-free &amp; context-sensitive) as a dynamic and adaptive design solution to aid the effectuation of self-organization.&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.

However, the next major challenge to put these ideas into practice. In this part I will discuss the praxis or enactment of the ESO-Loop Framework. It can be viewed as an effort to connect the theoretical concepts to successful practical applications. \n<br>\n<br>This design is developed by basing my design judgement on the current developments in ecological dynamics theory(CLA), ecological-anthropological approach to learning, current developments in entrepreneurship like contextualization, etc. I have previously discussed why self-organization is a ubiquitous feature found in nature. Open complex systems have a tendency to self-organize. Such self-organization is considered ideal because of its ecological groundedness and adaptation capabilities. Self-organizing systems make use of the co-evolutionary potential of other systems around them, a supremely intelligent action that cannot be replicated by top-down approaches. It makes use of distributed intelligence without even knowing the existence of such a superior intelligence. In this framework entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs are viewed as self-organizing systems and it is enacted by 4 processes happening simultaneously. They are;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>1.

First, there are asymmetric power relations between and within levels. Humans are intentional actors and can have designs on controlling or influencing a system through individual or institutional action, for example, by the implementation of public policy (Gilbert et al, 2015),.&nbsp;Second, the social domains like entrepreneurship are full of decontextualized advice, one size fits all models, rigid prescriptions, etc. Starting from the local level, people will start to influence your judgement based on their own anecdotal theories and cliche advice. If we try to follow their advice or use prescriptive models like lean-startup that may directly go against the self-organization principle.&nbsp;On the other hand, if we try to shut down ideas and information coming from environment, that will go against our meta-disposition like diversity, exploration and enskillment, etc. Most of these ideas maybe good and useful in another context. These ideas will enrich our understanding about the taskscape.&nbsp;<br><br>This points to the autonomy principle of self-organizing systems (De Wolf and Holvoet, 2004), which is the absence of external control. A system needs to organize without interference from the outside. But such lack of external control and autonomy does not mean that the system can have no input at all. Input is possible and important as long as the inputs are no control instructions from outside the system. The decision on what to do next should be made completely inside the system, i.e. the system is autonomous.\n<br><br>For self-organization, ESO-Loop uses Effectual Self-organization, a list of heuristics adopted from effectuation theory and science of self-organization, making it the central praxis or a primary constrain. This can be considered as a way to enact what can be called a mindful application or simulation of self-organization principles observed in nature and studied by natural sciences. Here, the entrepreneur doesn't employ any top-down approaches prescribed to them but uses the context as the central constrain from which action emerges.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>In the adapted version for the EsoLoop, effectuation principles will be used as effectual self-organization&nbsp;heuristics. Following are the list of heuristics or primary constraint&nbsp;entrepreneurs use.</b><br><br><b>l. Deliberately act like self-organizing&nbsp;systems&nbsp;</b><b><br></b>Self-organization is often called the invisible hand of nature and economy. A kind of supremely intelligent natural process that is ubiquitous in universe. Entrepreneurs as the first principle or first constraint act like self-organizing systems. More specific heuristics are the following;&nbsp;<br><br><b>1. Start from the disposition:</b> Self-organizing entrepreneurs start from knowing their disposition. They begin with asking who they are, what they know, and whom they know. This corresponds to the idea of acting based on the disposition of phase space or state space of a complex adaptive system. Here entrepreneur will make stock of the existing means.&nbsp;<br><br><b>2. Act in the adjacent possible space:</b> Self-organizing entrepreneurs act in the adjacent possible space. They look for the possible and take action immediately. Entrepreneurs here focus on what they can do and do it without worrying much about the best thing to do. The emphasis here is on creating something new with existing means rather than discovering new ways to achieve given goals.&nbsp; <br><br><b>3. Make use of co-evolutionary potential of other agents:</b> Self-organizing entrepreneur make use of co-evolutionary potential of other agents, more specifically stakeholder. They influence evolution of others and they are influenced by others(stakeholders). This is equal to the crazy-quilt principle of effectuation which involves negotiating with any and all stakeholders who are willing to make actual commitments to the project, without worrying about opportunity costs, or carrying out elaborate competitive analyses. The agents who comes on board has the potential to determines the goals of the venture.&nbsp;<br><br><b>4. Acknowledge, appropriate, leverage and embrace emergent realities:</b> Self-organizing entrepreneur leverages emergent property. They are aware of emergence, thus view it as a reality to be embraced. This can find some equivalency with the lemonade principle of effectuation which suggests for acknowledging and appropriating contingency by leveraging surprises rather than trying to avoid them, overcome them, or adapt to them. In the effectual self-organization model adaptation is a foundational.&nbsp;<br><br><b>5. Act based on the present emergent disposition, i.e. new means, new goals, new dispositions; Cycle</b>: This is about viewing the process as a continues ones. It is always grounded in current emergent disposition. Current disposition of the system is always the key factor influencing the evolutionary potential of the system. New goals, new agents, new means all for the current disposition.&nbsp;This can find equivalency with the effectual cycle that suggests for cycling through five core principles in a non-linear manner or simultaneously(bird-in-hand, affordable-loss, crazy-quilt, lemonade, pilot-in-the-plane). This also involves two types of converging cycles mentioned; expanding means and converging goals. The expanding-means cycle looks for increases in resources, and the Converging goals cycle adapts the goals. The cycle continues.<br><br><br><b>ll. Use enabling constraints like Stakeholder commitments, Affordable loss, etc.</b><b><br></b><b><br></b> An enabling constraint is a kind of constraint that limits certain possibilities so as to enable certain other desirable possibilities. Traffic conventions is an example. It allows smooth traffic.&nbsp;Stakeholder commitments and Affordable loss are enabling constraints that reduces huge array of options from the entrepreneurs space, so that the entrepreneur can focus on limited array of actionable possibilities. Thus it reduces uncertainty.&nbsp;The affordable-loss principle prescribes for committing in advance to what one is willing to lose rather than investing in calculations about expected returns to the project. Some of the people entrepreneurs interact with will self-select into the process by making commitments to the venture. Each commitment results in new means and new goals for the venture. Entrepreneurs will actively commitments.<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 2\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse3\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse3\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2. Constraints: Context-Sensitive and Context-Free</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"sign mbr-iconfont mbri-arrow-down\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse3\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\"><b>Context-Sensitive and Context-Free Constraints&nbsp;<br></b>&nbsp;<br>Self-organization alone may not result in great outcomes. Like the bible parable of the \"sower&nbsp; of seed\", only the seeds that fell on the good soil will self-organize to produce great corn. Entrepreneurs can be affected by issues like bounded rationality, local search behavior whereby they primarily explore opportunities that fit with their existing disposition and knowledge, etc. This leads to the identification of local optima rather than global optima. This makes it important to have a kind of Self-organization that relies on a balance between exploitation and exploration (Bonabeau et al. 1999; Foreby. et.al 2016). The seed will self-organize if provided with basic conditions., but the thriving of the seed to corn or tree depends on many other conditions. <br><br>In ESO-Loop, I have talked about using two kinds of constraints to positively bias the self-organization towards a global-optima or a better position. These are Context-sensitive constraints and Context-free constraints. Context-free constraints take a system's components far from equiprobability, and context-sensitive constraints synchronize and correlate previously independent parts into a systemic whole.&nbsp;A context-sensitive constraint is something that is conditional on a state in the context. When organized into a complex, integral whole, parts become correlated as a function of context-dependent constraints imposed on them by the newly organized system in which they are now embedded. A context-free constraint can be seen as a bias, assumption, preference, shared vision, intentions, etc.&nbsp; <br><br>I have listed 8 context-sensitive constraint dimensions and 7 context-free contraints that are globally applicable to the framework and the users alike. The 8 context-sensitive constraints include; Agent, Socio-materiality, Temporal and Contextual Factors, Real Needs/Wants/Choices, Organization, Network and ecosystem dependencies, Atmosphere, Unconventional forces. The 7 context-free constraints are&nbsp;Agency, Diversity, Enskilment,&nbsp;Affordances Ecological Validity and 4E, Adaptiveness, Evolvability, A permanent work in progress.<br><br><b>Both of these constraints can be visualized with the acronym ASTRONAUT:\n<br></b>\n<br><b>A. Agent/ The end user/Decision Maker:</b> The human being or the kind. This is the end-user to whom entrepreneurs cater to.\n<br>\n<br><b>S. Socio-Material Dimension Of The End User/Decision Maker:</b> The society and its dynamics including technology and material aspects in which the agent is embedded.\n<br>\n<br><b>T. Temporal and Contextual dimension of End User/Decision Maker:</b> Every moment of an agent's life represents a different context, which include dimensions like time, situation, role, relationships, etc. In here the context that is specific to entrepreneurship is important. The word temporal represents the Kairos time that is 'the right, critical, or opportune moment in relation to a context.\n<br>\n<br><b>R. Real Needs/Wants/Choices of end user/Decision Maker:</b> Human needs(or end user needs) are commonly used to refer to the drivers of people's actions, the motives behind human behavior. Such needs arise out of specific contexts. Even though I have changed the term to fit the acronym ASTRONAUT, It represents a deeper probe into the very nature of human needs and its emergent representations like wants, choices, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>O. Organization to deliver for R ( or Startup/ Venture/ Product/ Idea): </b>The fundamental function of an entrepreneurial organization is to cater to human needs. The organization here may be the entrepreneur, a product, or a startup.\n<br>\n<br><b>N. Networks and Ecosystem disposition:</b> This represents the direct connections and embeddedness of the organization(entrepreneur, a product, or a startup) in an ecosystem or bigger environment. More specifically we cab think of it as the disposition of the organization in the ecosystem.E.g. dimensions include Network effect, Platform model, Partners, etc.   \n<br> \n<br><b>A. Atmosphere:</b> This includes the general features of the entrepreneurship atmosphere or environment. For e.g. those represented by models like 5 forces, PESTLE, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>U. Unconventional Forces:</b> This includes things and forces that are unconventional, unknown or unseen, etc. Corona Virus, New exponential Technologies, Its combinations, etc.\n<br>\n<br><b>T.

The 8 context-sensitive constraint dimensions and 7 context-free constraints should be viewed as a scaffold which can be changed, updated and even eliminated after structural coherence is achieved. The basic scaffolding structure allows the entrepreneur to see the field of various constraints that influence the entrepreneurial self-organization in a single frame, that also in its dynamics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>2. The acronym ASTRONAUT can be metaphorically viewed as a football ground in which the ground and its structure can be visualized as context sensitive, and the game rules can be visualized as context free constraints. It also provides a shared frame and language to communicate ideas about constraints to team members and stakeholders. <br><br>3. The acronym ASTRONAUT enables the entrepreneur to view dysfunctional context free constraints that can negatively impact functional side of context sensitive constraints. Example; the dysfunctional and blind following of lean startup can be a context free constraint that can decouple the entrepreneur from environmental dynamics. Limiting beliefs can be another one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>4. Both context sensitive and context free constraints are highly dynamic and emergent. It is dynamic in the sense that it changes all the time. It changes according to the entrepreneurs idiosyncrasy, his dispositions, the venture idea, industry, etc. It is emergent in the sense that the dynamics can be effected with radically new formations, even unimaginable level of change would be normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>5.<b> </b>The awareness of various constraints scaffolded by the acronym ASTRONAUT will shape the ground for exploratory action which will be discussed next.&nbsp;<br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 3\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse4\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse4\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>3.

Using the scaffold of default context-sensitive and context free constraints(acronym ASTRONAUT) entrepreneur will explore the environment to learn the various features of the landscape, including various affordances available for the entrepreneur to act. This also includes the exploration for diversity which I have explained in part 2 i.e.----cognitive diversity, general diversity, diversity in Its dynamics(elements of diversity will interact, mutate, evolve and die), diversity that is uniquely in relation to the entrepreneurial agent in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Enskilment&nbsp;</b><b><br></b><br>The ecological-anthropological idea of enskilment will be used to explore, learn and navigate the entrepreneurial environment. In an enskilment perspective learning is inseparable from doing and place. It acknowledges the complex ecological view of entangled and relational view of real world learning contexts.&nbsp;According to Ingold (2000), enskilment is \"understanding in practice”. . . in which learning is inseparable from doing, and in which both are embedded in the context of a practical engagement in the world’ (Ingold, 2000, p. 416). To be enskiled thus is to be skilful and knowledgeable at a particular thing in a particular setting. It refers to the deep practical know-how that skilled people seem to possess in relation to their occupation and location. In enskilment, the unit of analysis is not the autonomous individual who is separated from the social world by the surface of the body or a natural being who passively internalizes the mental scripts of the cultural environment, but rather the whole person in action, acting within the contexts of that activity\" (Pálsson, 1994).\nThus, becoming enskiled cannot occur separately, in isolation from context or experience, as it grows in the messiness of the noisy ‘real-world’. This contextualized view of enskilment fits perfectly with the growing call for contextualization in the domain of entrepreneurship education.<br><br><b>Following are they key pointers to implement the enskilemnt approach.&nbsp;<br></b><br>1. Enskilment includes four major ‘threads’; They are are Taskscape, Wayfinding, Guided attention, Storytelling. Each component is entangled to support enskilment—the taskscape is viewed as the performance environment of the entrepreneur; The wayfinding is viewed as an actively self-organizing and self-regulating entrepreneur who exploring the environment ; The guided attention refers to the role of the more knowledgeable others like educators, mentors, specialists, customers or any other agents who are more knowledgeable at any aspects of the environment; The storytelling enriches the attunement of the entrepreneur to various features and affordances of the environment. <br><br>2.In this conception the entrepreneur is viewed as the wayfinder who explores the taskscape(environment) to learn about various features of the landscape. They actively seek guided attention and place based stories from the more knowledgeable others. The more-knowledgeable others&nbsp;in the entrepreneurship context can be people, organizations or artifacts like devises, internet, books, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp;In the case of entrepreneurship, taskscape is the unique performance environment in which a particular entrepreneur is embedded. According to Ingold, people become enskilled by dwelling within various places—meaning that learning about a place is inseparable from being in a place. It is by dwelling that people learn to become familiar with a place’s features, which includes the tasks of other inhabitants that “make up the pattern of activity of a community” (Ingold, 2000; p. 325). From this dwelling perspective, a task can be understood as a practical, goal-directed activity undertaken by an individual interacting with an environment. So, then, the taskscape is the “entire ensemble of tasks in their mutual interlocking” (Ingold, 2000; p. 195). The idea of mutual interlocking emphasizes that tasks are never completed in isolation, but only exist in an enmeshment of people, organizations, artifacts, events, etc interacting with each other and a performance environment.<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Wayfinding (Ingold, 2000) is best described as an experiential and narrative way of moving through a landscape as one continues to learn it. It is the process of embarking upon a purposeful, intentional, and self-regulated journey that takes an individual from an intended region in one landscape to another.&nbsp;The dynamics of wayfinding would require the entrepreneur to develop an intimate knowledge of a taskscape’s informational constraints such as socio-material features, climate, socio-cultural norms, rules, and local history. It also requires an understanding of how such things enmesh to shape the entrepreneur's perceptions and actions through an evolving attunement and attentiveness to various opportunities for environmental interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>4. Guided attention positions a more knowledgeable other or others as agents who guide the attention of the wayfinding learner. This is the role played by coaches, educators, mentors, organization, artifacts, etc in the entrepreneurship domain. This approach to education is ‘hands-on, not in the hard sense of instructing, but in the soft sense of guiding—guiding one’s attention toward the direct perception of things that may otherwise be cloaked to them by watching, listening, or feeling (Woods et al, 2021). Guiding an entrepreneur’s attention to informational properties that support performance in the taskscape can take shape in a variety of ways. According to Prins and Wattchow(2020), guiding a performer's attention \"relies upon anticipating and knowing what to do and when to do it in any given context and with any learner. This relates not only to the task but also the complex array of what the learner needs at that particular moment in the taskscape. If the pedagogic moment is fulfilled, the learner’s attention is drawn to the right thing—at the right time—in the right place—in the right way\"\n<br>\n<br>5. Place-based stories and storytelling&nbsp;in the enskilemnt perspective are not just a representation or an account of what has happened but rather, a continual communication that is also a way humans make sense of their world. With this account Ingold (2000) states: \"I don’t believe, however, that their purpose is a representational one. Telling a story is not like weaving a tapestry to cover up the world or, as in an over worn anthropological metaphor, to ‘clothe it with meaning’. Far from dressing up a plain reality with layers of metaphor, or representing it, map like, in the imagination, songs, stories and designs serve to conduct the attention of performers into the world, deeper and deeper, as one proceeds from outward appearances to an ever more poetic involvement\"(p. 56). When learning how to wayfind, a person must pay careful attention to the many stories told in situ as well as direct experience that place many times for themselves (Ingold, 2000; Tyrrell, 2006). Stories thus help guide attentiveness, and attentiveness leads to becoming more deeply enskiled in the taskscape. \n<br>\n<br>6. When it comes to entrepreneurship we need to stress the need for a distributed form of enskilemnt. This means in entrepreneurship not a single individual is the wayfinder. There could be multiple agents parallelly exploring the environment. For e.g. the technology co-founder maybe exploring the technology environment more than a sales specialist. Similarly the source of guided attention or educating the attention of the entrepreneur will also be distributed across the taskscape. Thus a person who is familiar with law of the land, a lawyer, will provide guided attention about the legal side of the startup; A person who specializes in design will provide guided attention towards the different potential solutions; A person who knows deeply about the platform business model can provide guided attention to information regarding platformization, etc. Wayfinding entrepreneurs can seek information from multiple agents operating in the same, different, or parallel parts of taskscape. E.g. Multiple customers about the same problem, etc. Further, a&nbsp;single story may be biased or may stress only a few aspects of the features of the taskscape. Thus entrepreneurs need to seek different types of stories from people from diverse taskscapes in order to capture the richness of the land we are exploring.&nbsp;<br><br>7. Constrain to afford; The enskilment approach can be viewed as a wayfinding entrepreneur exploring the world for various affordances, navigating various environmental constraints. The guided attention and storytelling are viewed as informational constraints that can channel the entrepreneur's attention to various affordances available to him/her. The entrepreneur will become progressively attuned and calibrated to various features of the environment, so that even slight changes in the environment can be detected.</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 4\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse5\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse5\">\n                                   <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>4.

Now we need a constraint that enables us to make sense of the current emergent disposition at a meta level so that other factors like entrepreneurs own life, existence, family, purpose, etc, can also be taken into account. Here I propose Meta-Enactive Sensemaking which includes sense-making along with actionability. The idea of sensemaking as a central concept is adapted from Dave Snowden. According to him sensemaking is about----“How do we make sense of the world so we can act in it”(Snowden, 2008). Such sense-making is also influenced by our action, history of actions and current actionability. Thus sense-making is inseparable from action and actionability. Following are key pointers;<br><br><br><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>1. This involves continuously attempting to sense-make about the state-space and the self-organizing system as a whole in its dynamics and taking appropriate action(Meta-Action) or design(Meta-design) to learn, explore, enable possibilities, solve problems or limitations, etc. \n<br>\n<br>2. It asserts the importance of entrepreneurs having a holistic perspective and not just assume that the act of entrepreneurship is separate from other things in life like deep values, health, society, family, relationship, happiness, meaning, etc. This is about the awareness that things in life cannot be understood in isolation. In other-words this is a conscious effort not to see the world as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. \n<br>\n<br>3. The importance of action is asserted in-order to stress the inseparability of cognition from context and the need or ability to act or design. This is based on insights from ecological (Gibson, 1979); embodied, embedded, enactive (Varela et al., 1992), and extended (Clark and Chalmers, 1998) perspectives of human behavior and decision making. \n<br>\n<br>4. This also involves the ability of entrepreneurs to identify bounded rationality, dysfunctional biases, fixation errors, framing effects, etc. It must enable entrepreneurial exploration towards interdisciplinary intelligence, particularly those which is outside the primary design of this framework. It also must aid in deciding when to use focused convergent thinking(exploitative), diffused divergent thinking(Exploratory), Disruptive re-framing, etc. \n<br>\n<br>5. The meta-action and meta-design are two important components of meta-enactive sense-making. The meta-action seeks to keep the meta-level sense-making while taking action. The meta-design involves progressively creating better design and designability for themselves, designers, users, etc. In practice, the framework is a meta-design framework that enables entrepreneurs better self-organization. While meta action seeks to act spontaneously, Meta-design may involve slow and strategic design solutions for problems. \n<br>\n<br>6. Specific smart frameworks like Cynefin(Snowden, 2010) and others (Wiki, 2022) can be used for this purpose. Cynefin for example enables entrepreneurs to sense-make about domain of problems which the are encountering. E.g. Clear, Complicated, Complex, and Chaotic, Each of which require different actions and design.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 5\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingThree\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse6\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse6\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>For Educators</b></h6>\n                                    <span class=\"mbr-iconfont mobi-mbri-arrow-down mobi-mbri\"></span>\n                                </a>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapse6\" class=\"panel-collapse noScroll collapse\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"headingThree\">\n                                <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                                    <p class=\"mbr-fonts-style panel-text\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-text\">\n                                       Educators are enablers&nbsp;</p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n</section>",

It is essential that solutions designed for complex domains like entrepreneurship must consider factors like non-linearity, inter-relatedness, emergent property, etc. In contrast to most of the existing models like lean-startup, business plan, etc., this framework is a contextually adaptive entrepreneurial framework for a complex and emergent world. It balances self-organization, a kind of exploit in the local adjacent possible, and exploration towards the global optima. It then uses the meta-dispositions as context-free constraints that drive the proclivities of the entrepreneur and the framework itself. \n<br>\n<br><b>In contrast to the existing entrepreneurial thinking space, the following are some of the key advantages of the framework. \n<br></b>\n<br><b>Contrary to other models and methods, ESO-Loop is built on insights from complexity science.</b> Everybody may agree that entrepreneurship is a complex domain. But actions don't follow through with this agreement. If one agrees or asserts that a domain is complex, he or she must use complexity as the fundamental frame to view, analyze and understand such a domain. No amount of linear approaches, no amount of lean, or planning will compensate for ignoring the underlying nonlinear dynamics of a complex system like entrepreneurship. ESO-Loop is a complexity-science-informed design solution to aid entrepreneurial actions. This is based on the scientific understanding that all open complex adaptive systems have a tendency to self-organize under various constraints. Entrepreneurship is also a complex adaptive system that self-organize under constraints like informational, environmental, cognitive, resources, etc. None of the existing models directly use complexity as a frame.<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to other models and methods, ESO-Loop stresses the need to harmonize the growing collective human intelligence.</b> This also includes both practitioner and academia developed ideas. ESO-Loop attempts to bring it all accessible and affordable for the entrepreneurial actor at the time of his/her decision making and action. This framework promotes other people's models, ideas, and insights. To use an analogy, most of the existing entrepreneurship advice, and models(prescriptive and descriptive) on entrepreneurship are like apps. This framework is like an app platform like Android or IOS(without the modularity), which enables and even forces constant updation. This means you never have to settle with one or two preinstalled apps(E.g. Lean-startup or Business plan). The framework enables adding of more ideas, heuristics, models like---bricolage, design thinking, user innovation, etc, or build your own models. Once a model or idea is brought inside the framework, its propensities like binarization, exclusionism, polarization, parasitism, etc will no longer work. It will be one among many types of variation the agent can use. \n<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to other models and methods, ESO-Loop promotes interdisciplinary exploration.</b> Even though real-world problems and their solutions are interdisciplinary in nature, most existing entrepreneurial prescriptive models are the result of disciplinary reductionism. It often comes as rigid processes that lack flexibility. Using these models without understanding laws of entrepreneurial complexity could seriously impair the ability to integrate the wholeness of the human individual, social, material realities. This framework has enabling constraints for exploration without boundaries. It is also inclusive of contradictions and diversities. \n<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to other models and methods, ESO-Loop makes it easier for you to transparently see and navigate the big picture(The Forest), even if you had to attend to the contextual demands(The Tree).</b> Because the framework is built over insights from complexity science, it stresses the need to start the thinking from a holistic perspective. The world view it beholds is deep ecology, which is an ecological perspective that does not separate humans--or anything else-from the natural environment. It sees the world not as a collection of isolated objects, but as a network of phenomena that are fundamentally interconnected and interdependent. In real-world stressful decision contexts, we may not be able to view the world from a holistic perspective. Every context is like a black hole, and It demands our cognitive and physical resources. This framework act as an enabler for you to see the big picture simultaneously. It provides the transparency to see hidden forces in action. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, ESO-Loop is mutable, adaptable, evolvable. Most ideas and models in the entrepreneurship domain are self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. </b>This often works against the agent's evolutionary potential because it gives a false sense of comfort and certainty, blinding the agent from ever realizing the true emergent nature of entrepreneurial complexity. This framework embodies a Work In Progress attitude with a total acceptance of its own possible weakness. It can be changed and designed to suit the idiosyncrasy of the user and the complexity of the context. Secondly, the structure of constraints in part 2 (lll) could be(not necessary) seen as a scaffold. A scaffold is a temporary structure used to support the development of a structure. It is not meant to be permanent. Existing prescriptive models and frameworks propose permanent structures that end up being inflexible. These constraints are not designed as a permanent structure but as an impermanent scaffold that enables initial emergence. Further, this framework is an adaptive system. An adaptive system involves designing the elements of a system to find by themselves the solution of the problem. Like this, when the problem changes, the elements are able to dynamically find a new solution(Gershenson, 2007). Existing prescriptive models are ignorant of the possibility of their own mutability. \n<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, ESO-Loop promotes effective learning and transfer that reflects in the structure of the framework itself.</b> It encapsulates various complexity-friendly functional dispositions into a single framework so that an ecology of ideas in its dynamics will transfer to the users, not just one or two ideas or a process. Further, learning something at one point in time and using it adaptively at a different temporal decision context is extremely challenging. This is because isolated ideas don't sustain without connecting with a meaningful preexisting knowledge or contextual application. Without the existence of meaningful coherence, it is very difficult to transfer our learning to adaptive, unknown, and emergent contexts. ESO-Loop does three things: 1) It gives a permanent position, a meaningful coherent structure in which you can build on, place, and connect newly learned ideas and models 2) It forces constant updation. It enables and encourages you to learn, unlearn, add, remove, design, create, combine, remix, recombine and customize solutions to suit the ever-changing dynamics 3) It will enable and encourage you to design your own emergent solutions for learning and transfer problem rather than attempting to prescribe any one-size-fits-all advice. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br><b>Contrary to existing prescriptive models, ESO-Loop has inbuilt elements of Immunity against Cognitive Hijacking, Disciplinary Darkness &amp; Certainty Merchants.</b> Human rationality is bounded. In a complex and uncertain world, we make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. This results in the tendency of the human brain to solve problems in the most simple and straightforward way rather than utilizing a more sophisticated and effort-intensive way. This human weakness is often exploited by certainty merchants (Espinosa, 2015) who come up with confident advice and one-size-fits-all models. Further, people with disciplinary/domain commitments become more committed to disciplinary/domain boundaries and methods aligning perfectly with legacy incentive structures over time. I would like to label this as a kind of cognitive hijacking where the agent's evolutionary, learning, the adaptive potential is being compromised because of strong preexisting one-size-fits-all models and other commitments. This framework is designed to create default immunity against Cognitive Hijacking. The meta-dispositions are intended to scan the phase space for potential elements of bounded rationality and fixation errors that can prevent exploration and effective self-organization.&nbsp;<b></b></p>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"card mb-3\" mbr-if=\"cardAmount > 1\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" role=\"tab\" id=\"headingTwo\">\n                                <a role=\"button\" class=\"collapsed panel-title text-black\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-core href=\"#collapse2\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapse2\">\n                                    <h6 class=\"panel-title-edit mbr-fonts-style mb-0\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" data-app-selector=\".panel-title-edit\"><b>2.
